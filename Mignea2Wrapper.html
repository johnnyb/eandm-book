 id="x1-30002.1"></a>Why the &#8220;universal physical copy machine&#8221; approach is not adequate</h4>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >This approach assumes that the SSR contains a sophisticated machine that can examine
and accurately copy all other pieces and machinery comprising the mature SSR. This
implies that this universal physical copy machine can even copy itself or, more realistically,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
make a copy of a copy of itself. In other words, the SSR contains two universal physical
copy machines. One, Machine A, is performing the actual copying of all SSR
machinery and the other universal physical copy machine, Machine B. So the
second copy machine, Machine B, is only used as a model for the first Machine A.
The goal for this solution is to use these copy machines A and B to alleviate
the need to store as much information about the SSR itself, to have as much
software, and to contain as much computer-controlled machinery as in the second
approach.

<!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >       Although the original impetus for Solution 1 is to avoid mountains of information
and armies of automatons and machinery, this solution requires those ingredients. There is
no magic copy machine that can do its work without structured collections of information
and many helper automatons (machinery) that, in turn, must be information-, software-,
and computer-controlled. The conclusion is that there is no &#8220;magic universal physical
copy machine&#8221; solution that is significantly distinguishable from the Solution
2.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="indent" >       Another problem with Solution 1 is that certain components of Machine B may not
be fabricated by plain (mechanical) assemblage of parts but rather by using more
demanding assemblage processes, such as welding or electro-chemical processes. These
processes have no precise means of disassembly, which would prevent the universal physical
copy machine from being able to reproduce them.

<a

<!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >When approaching the task of the design and implementation of an artificial SSR, a
capital question surfaces rather quickly: What should be the material basis for the
artificial SSR? There are two distinct possibilities: Either use a biological basis for
the SSR on a micro/nano scale or use more common macro scale materials and
technology.

<a 
 id="dx1-6001"></a>
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >Using a biological basis for the SSR means that the SSR must be constructed using organic
materials. These materials would be the same or similar to those used by the cells, tissues,
and organs of the living world. There are several advantages to this approach. First, the
proof in the feasibility of this approach is the presence of the varied organisms and
microorganisms in nature. A key question is whether this approach is accessible given
current engineering technologies. Second, even though energy generation is one
of the biggest challenges for SSR replication, there are known levels of energy
consumption based on biological systems. Lastly, biological systems tend to be
in aqueous medium, which may facilitate solutions for the variable geometry
problem.
</p><!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >       The biological approach is not without its setbacks. First, since this approach
operates at extremely small scales, it taxes the limits of current investigative tools and
observational methods. The most advanced microbiology manipulation and fabrication
tools/approaches are still rather primitive and very limited when considering the tasks that
need to be accomplished: fabrication, assemblage, manipulation at nano scales, computing
machinery fabrication, software execution, information storage, and communication.
Secondly, there are many aspects of cell biology that are still beyond current
understandings of the cell&#8217;s function. Examples of the challenges that we cannot solve with
current technology include

<!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" >The other alternative for consideration is the macro scale approach, using materials and
technology that are in common use for product fabrication. This approach must consider
the minimum dimensional scales for which there are available manufacturing
technologies for most of the parts, components, and machinery that make up the
SSR.
</p><!--l. 235--><p class="indent" >       The materials used to construct the SSR enclosure, SSR scaffolding, and SSR
interior should be common engineering materials used by current fabrication technologies:
metals, alloys, plastics, ceramics, silicon or other special materials. The scale of
these artifacts to be fabricated as elements of the artificial SSR must be selected
with care as there are two opposing considerations which must be balanced and
compromised.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >       The first consideration is that the smallest possible scale should be used in the
design and implementation of the artificial SSR parts in order to minimize the
energy consumed by the SSR during a replication cycle and minimize the size,
volume and mass of the artificial SSR in order to minimize the number of materials
ingested into the artificial SSR and used for fabrication of the clone within the
SSR.
</p><!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >       However, this must be balanced with the limitations of known engineering
technologies and machinery to fabricate, manipulate and assemble all the parts of the SSR
machinery. This means, for an illustrative example, that if the minimum size of
semiconductor fabrication equipment that is being manufactured today is 0.5 meters, then
the designed size of the mature artificial SSR cannot be smaller than 1 meter. Therefore, a
more realistic artificial SSR design would have dimensions in the range of at least 10&#8211;100

<!--l. 317--><p class="noindent" >If each SSR machine is power-driven, then certain significant consequences arise in
designing an artificial SSR:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The SSR must have a power distribution network (e.g., an electrical distribution
      network) that must reach each of the SSR&#8217;s machinery. The design of the layout
      and geometry of the power network must consider the variable geometry of
      the  SSR  enclosure,  scaffolding,  and  interior  space  and  structure.  Particular
      consideration must be made for the zones affected by growth and shape changes.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Each SSR machine must be designed to use and consume power (electricity) at
      a level adequate for its nature and the actions it performs.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The machinery is computer driven, which means that either there is a parallel
      SSR power network for an energy level (e.g., voltage) adequate for computing
      devices,  or  each  machine  must  have  some  adequate  power  converters  (e.g.,
      electrical power supplies or batteries).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The SSR machines that provide mechanical work or movement must be provided
      with motors (rotational and/or linear) adequate for their nature.

      <li class="itemize">Mobile machinery (e.g., transporters, moving robots) must be designed such
      that their mobility is not constrained while they are connected to the SSR
      power network(s). Designing all mobile machinery with rechargeable batteries
      may solve or significantly simplify the connectivity constraints but will require
      additional  provisions  for  battery  fabrication  processes  and  fabrication  and
      provision of battery charging stations.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The design of each machine must provide specification for the average power
      consumption on all power networks (normal power level and computer power
      level) to which the machine is connected.</li></ul>

      <li class="itemize">The  SSR  must  have  highly  technical  machinery  and  processes  to  fabricate
      computers and their respective parts.

      <li class="itemize">Each SSR machine that hosts computing devices must be networked&#8212;by wire
      or wirelessly&#8212;to other machines and control centers within the SSR.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The SSR must have adequate machinery to not only fabricate computers but
      to install them into other SSR machines, plug them into the other machine&#8217;s
      power network, and connect them to the SSR&#8217;s communication network.

      any computer installed into an SSR machine, to start (boot) that software on
      the machine, and to monitor its availability and behavior.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The SSR must have the capability to test each piece of its machinery, to detect
      malfunctions in computer and software installations as well as in the machine
      hardware, to detect malfunctions in the computer and software execution and
      to have adequate procedures to diagnose and repair the identified problems.
      Diagnosis and repair may be based on the availability of fabricated spare parts.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The software that drives each particular piece of machinery must be designed
      and written with a full understanding of the physical and cinematic capabilities
      and constraints of that piece of machinery. It must take into account all possible
      uses of the machine and all its components&#8217; behaviors and interactions with
      external objects and events as well as be able to handle them correctly.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The software that drives fabrication and assemblage machinery and materials
      and fabrication processes needs to be based on a thorough design of the machines
      that will be built, their cinematic capabilities, and their specified power and
      energy consumption.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The software written for various SSR functions must carefully and accurately
      coordinate  and  synchronize  the  activities  of  multiple  SSR  machines  (e.g.,
      fabrication machines, material process machines, manipulation and transport
      robots/arms, assemblage and construction machines) by providing a continuous
      monitoring of the 3D spaces occupied by each machine and its mobile parts to
      avoid collisions and to ensure cooperative progress with both lower level and
      higher level tasks of the growing SSR.</li></ul>

<!--l. 440--><p class="noindent" >The energy generation and energy closure challenge presents multiple hurdles which must
be resolved. Primarily, the SSR design must select an adequate basis for energy generation.
This depends on what natural materials are available in the SSR environment that can
be used for energy generation. Some of the candidate material basis for energy
generation that might be considered for the design and implementation of an
artificial SSR might include biochemical or organic (e.g., vegetation used for energy
generation), coal, oil/petroleum, natural gas, methanol, hydrogen, solar, wind, and/or
nuclear.
</p><!--l. 449--><p class="indent" >       The <span

transport, manipulators, robots, computers, and networking gear) that equip the
SSR.
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >       Other challenges associated with energy closure include the following:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The SSR must be designed with the ability to slow down or even completely
      shut down during the periods when the input of energy producing materials is

      accumulators  or  stocking  energy-producing  materials)  may  smooth  out  or
      eliminate the need for transition to &#8220;hibernation&#8221; or shutdown states.

      <li class="itemize">Designing  SSR  machines  with  local  sources  of  energy  (e.g.,  rechargeable

      implementation difficulties related to keeping all mobile machines hooked to
      flexible power wiring or network wiring.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Burning  fuels  or  chemically  generating  energy  leads  to  additional  concerns
      in designing and implementing an artificial SSR. Particular concerns include
      preserving the SSR&#8217;s internal environmental parameters (e.g., temperature and

information. Completing the hardware and software requirements further extends the
information closure requirement by demanding that the computing hardware and software
present in the SSR together with the information resident in the SSR are sufficient to drive,
control, and successfully complete the cloning and division phases of SSR replication. The
SSR&#8217;s hardware and software must provide full automation of the control, fabrication,
assemblage, and the handling of special situations like error detection, error repair, and
recovery after error.

procedures, plans, spatial structures, error and recovery handling, etc.). Completeness
means also that the information designed and stored in the SSR is correctly correlated with
the SSR environment. That means, for example, that the SSR design should be based on
an accurate and exhaustive list of raw materials and raw parts that exist in the SSR
environment together with the material identification procedures and material
processing/extraction procedures for those materials. Additionally, it must be
adequate for the task in that it must cover all descriptive details of all entries in the

       of the proper set of machines, tools, and teleoperated mechanisms to
       permit both production of useful output and reproduction to make

       Later, in the same chapter, the project of making a self-replicating lunar factory is
described in detail:
       The  Replicating  Systems  Concepts  Team  proposed  the  design  and
       construction  of  an  automated,  multiproduct,  remotely  controlled  or
       autonomous,  and  reprogrammable  lunar  manufacturing  facility  able
       to construct duplicates (in addition to productive output) that would
       be  capable  of  further  replication.  The  team  reviewed  the  extensive
       theoretical  basis  for  self-reproducing  automata  and  examined  the
       engineering  feasibility  of  replicating  systems  generally.  The  mission
       scenarios  presented  in  chapter  5  include  designs  that  illustrate  two
       distinct approaches&#8212;a replication model and a growth model&#8212;with
       representative  numerical  values  for  critical  subsystem  parameters.
       Possible development and demonstration programs are suggested, the
       complex  issue  of  closure  discussed,  and  the  many  applications  and
       implications of replicating systems are considered at length. (<a

Someday, such a factory might replicate itself, or at least produce most of its own
components, so that the number of facilities could grow very rapidly from a single seed&#8221;

       The project discusses certain details for a self-replicating lunar factory to be
feasible. For one, the seed of the lunar factory that would need to be transported from
Earth would likely weigh one hundred tons. Additionally, not all of the machinery could be
built on the Moon. Certain items, such as computer boards, would need to be brought
from Earth since those parts are much too complex to manufacture on the lunar
factory. These additional, externally synthesized items are similar to vitamins,
which are compounds organisms need to survive but cannot usually synthesize
themselves. Scientists estimated that this project would be feasible in the 21st
century.

       The NASA study represents a thorough, realistic evaluation of the extent that
designing a macro-scale (kilometers) self-replicator would entail. It addresses various
problems that need to be solved and difficulties that would need to be overcome in order to
successfully make a large self-replicator.

<!--l. 896--><p class="noindent" >While the discussion so far has focused on building a fully-autonomous SSR and the
difficulties encountered therein, it is possible to reduce the complexity of its design and
construction by making some simplifying assumptions. These might include the
following:
</p><!--l. 901--><p class="indent" >
      </p><ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23003x1">Eliminate the requirement that the SSR produces its own energy. The electrical
      energy (at an appropriate voltage/amperage) will be supplied to the artificial
      SSR from the environment.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23005x2">Eliminate the requirement that the SSR has the ability to select, identify and
      accept through its input gateway appropriate raw materials. All raw materials
      will be supplied as stock materials to the artificial SSR. An additional, optional
      simplification could be that all stock materials are labeled appropriately (e.g.,
      with bar codes or RFIDs labels). However, as an illustration, the SSR will still
      need to use stock copper fed through the input gateways to fabricate copper
      wires of certain gauges or to use copper in the fabrication of electrical motor
      parts.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23007x3">Eliminate  the  requirement  that  the  SSR  fabricate  the  most  technically
      demanding   parts,   components,   and   assemblies   (e.g.,   computer   boards,
      microprocessors, semiconductor chips, memories, etc.). These high-technology
      parts/components (referred to as &#8220;vitamins&#8221; in the self-replication literature)
      will be supplied and carefully labeled from the environment through the input
      gateways.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23009x4">Eliminate the requirement that the SSR must fabricate any part, component,
      assembly or machinery from basic materials. The SSR will be supplied with
      pre-manufactured parts that are used in the composition of all its machinery,
      scaffolding  and  enclosure.  This  simplifying  assumption  means  that  now  the
      SSR  needs  to  be  designed  as  a  (sophisticated)  self-assembler  that  achieves
      self-replication by assembling exact copies of itself using an exhaustive pool
      of all of the parts from the machinery/assemblies it is composed of and are
      supplied by the elementary parts coming through its input gateways.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-23011x5">Eliminate  the  requirement  that  the  information  repositories  (information
      catalogs)  that  drive  the  functions  of  the  SSR  reside  within  the  SSR.  This
      requirement needs to be replaced with requirements for the SSR to possess
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
      reliable,  high  speed  communication  capabilities  to  access  the  information
      catalogs (and possibly part of the software) residing somewhere outside the SSR.
      This assumption may simplify certain elements of the SSR design but will make
      other requirements, such as communication and availability, more stringent for
      both the SSR and for the external information resource.</li></ol>
<!--l. 940--><p class="indent" >       Even if the original requirements for the design and construction of an
autonomous, artificial SSR are relaxed and any or a combination of the above simplifying
assumptions are used as starting conditions for such a project, there are still significant
hurdles that need to be overcome in designing and constructing an artificial SSR.

 id="x1-2400010"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 949--><p class="noindent" >As is evident, the three closure rules which must be satisfied by a true self-replicator&#8212;energy
closure, material closure, and the information closure&#8212;place an extraordinary burden onto
the design and implementation of self-replicating objects. The SSR must be able to
produce and distribute energy, ingest raw materials to fabricate parts, and contain a
complete technical description of itself, its processes, and its assembly instructions.
Additionally, the environment for the SSR must also be considered, and perhaps
specially designed, in order to make available all of the necessary raw materials for
self-replication.
</p><!--l. 960--><p class="indent" >       While such replicators are known to exist on a biomolecular scale within
nature, current technology does not allow for creating a self-replicator at such small
scales. The macro scale implementation is more suited to present technology,
though this brings its own problems regarding the scale of energy and materials
consumption.
</p><!--l. 966--><p class="indent" >       While there have been many attempts to build self-replicators, none of them have
satisfied all three closure requirements. The NASA REPRO study was the most exhaustive
attempt to design a self-replicator, which estimated the replicator to weigh 100,000 tons
(unfueled) and reproduce every 500 years.
</p><!--l. 971--><p class="indent" >       While Part&#x00A0;1 and Part&#x00A0;2 of this paper contained an overview of the minimal
technological requirements of self-replication and foundational technological
implementation considerations, the existence of self-replication in nature comes
as quite a surprise. Therefore, Part&#x00A0;3 will cover speculative ideas for what the
existence of the self-replication process in nature indicates about the nature of
reality.
