                        TLL is used to model commitments for resource provision and consumption.  I think the SOMAS goals can be modelled this way (i.e. consume viruses, do not consume too much bandwidth, etc.), so it could be useful as a later step.  It would allow goals to be specified as an ongoing aspect of the system, instead of merely a end point, which is more useful.

                        The interaction model defines the protocol for exchanging messages, while the deontic model specifies constraints on the actions the agents take based on their observations.  With these two combined, properties can be checked using a model checker.

                        This seems to feed into the use of TLL in assigning goals and constraints to the problem definition that the agents are evolved for.  So, it is accordingly useful.

                        Seems v. good - points out the problem with my approach in the verification and analysis of the evolved swarms.  However, the emphasis is in robotics and the use of programmable material.  Also, the system is not truly self organized, the agents all know the global pattern they are supposed to follow, and know where they fall in the pattern.  It is emergent in that there is no online centralized planner, each agent makes its own decision based on the information available.

                        Also, seems my approach may have already been done in robotics, must check this.  However, after checking the referenced paper, the similarity didn't jump out to me.  Everything was very particularly defined, even though evolution was used. 

                        At any rate, v. interesting.  This can be useful as a subset of the SOMAS framework, as operators in the EA.  Can also provide inspiration for agent rules.

                        Supports the importance of cooperation among agents instead of each only accomplishing its own goals.  This implies the importance of swarms, vs individual autonomous agents.

                        It is a recent paper (2006), so it is a good baseline to use for comparing SOMAS.  The problem is task allocation among a cooperative, multi-agent system, which apparently has not been well addressed in the literature.  The authors show that the cooperative approach is more robust than the non-cooperative approach.

                        Ties into the new network briefing with its discussion of pervasive computing.

                        Great support for my approach - the nature of pervasive computing makes it very amenable to SOMAS, since there is no hierarchy, nor a predefined idea of what allows a system to work best.

                        This goes a step further to say the goals are not necessarily predefined either, which is something I need to address in more depth than just sying the SOMAS framework is iterative.

                        Also need to think more about the real world applications of SOMAS (since it is not just about computer networks).

                        "Intentional stance" is exactly the method I'm seeking, avoiding the whole constructive question as much as possible.

                        A problem is that the emphasis is on self organizing hierarchies, instead of heterachies.

                  		 amount of information needed for optimal prediction of
                  		 the system'sbehavior in the vicinity of a given point.
                  		 By examining the changingspatiotemporal distributions
                  		 of these quantities, we can find the coherentstructures
                  		 in a variety of pattern-forming cellular automata,
