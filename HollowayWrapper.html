<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Research comparing human cognitive capabilities to computer algorithms suggest humans
possess <a 
 id="dx1-1001"></a>supra-computational cognition. Humans are capable of finding good solutions to
computationally intractable problems, and this capability scales at a faster rate with larger
problems than the best known algorithms (Dry, Lee, Vickers, &amp; Hughes, <a 
href="#Xdry06:_human_perfor_visual_presen_travel">2006</a>). Many
popular games are algorithmically intractable to solve (<a 
href="#Xviglietta11:_gamin_is_hard_job_but">Viglietta</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xviglietta11:_gamin_is_hard_job_but">2011</a>). Programmers
appear capable of solving halting problems (<a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_calcul_softw_compl_using_haltin_probl">Bartlett</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_calcul_softw_compl_using_haltin_probl">2014a</a>). People can solve insight
problems, for which there is currently no known computational method (<a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_using_turin_oracl_in_cognit_model">Bartlett</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_using_turin_oracl_in_cognit_model">2014b</a>).
Observers can pick out targets in a picture relevant to their goal independently of the
target&#8217;s features (Gue, Preston, Das, Giesbrecht, &amp; Eckstein, <a 
href="#Xgue12:_featur_indep_neural_codin_of">2012</a>). Such capabilities
either have never been algorithmically emulated, or violate well known and well
substantiated computational constraints, such as the computational complexity of the
problem (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, &amp; Stein, <a 
href="#Xcormen01:_introd_to_algor">2001</a>), the <a 
 id="dx1-1002"></a>No Free Lunch Theorem
(NFLT) (<a 
href="#Xwolpert96:_no_free_lunch_theor_for_optim">Wolpert &amp; Macready</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwolpert96:_no_free_lunch_theor_for_optim">1996</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwolpert95:_no_free_lunch_theor_for_searc">1995</a>) and the halting problem (<a 
href="#Xcover06:_elemen_of_infor_theor">Cover &amp;
Thomas</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcover06:_elemen_of_infor_theor">2006</a>).
<a 
 id="dx1-1003"></a>
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >       Intelligent Design Theory (IDT) provides a formal language to account for
observations of supra-computational cognition. According to IDT, intelligent agents, such
as humans, are capable of creating a new form of information called <a 
 id="dx1-1004"></a>complex specified
information (CSI) (<a 
href="#Xdembski:_specif">Dembski</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdembski:_specif">2005</a>). Dembski&#8217;s work on <a 
 id="dx1-1005"></a>search algorithms (<a 
href="#Xdembski06:_conser_of_infor_in_searc">Dembski</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdembski06:_conser_of_infor_in_searc">2006</a>)
implies that if human interaction can be incorporated into a search and <a 
 id="dx1-1006"></a>optimization
algorithm, these algorithms can surpass the limitations of the NFLT over a wide variety of
hard problems. This is possible due to the unique ability of <a 
 id="dx1-1007"></a>intelligent agents, such as
humans, to create CSI. A further implication is the user does not need specialized
interfaces or training for each type of problem. The possibility of such a <a 
 id="dx1-1008"></a>generalized
interface is suggested by research demonstrating <a 
 id="dx1-1009"></a>context independent problem
solving by humans (Sperber, Cara, &amp; Girotto, <a 
href="#Xsperber95:_relev_theor_explain_selec_task">1995</a>) and suggested by IDT&#8217;s
implications.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Problem Description</h3>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >In the computational domain, it is problematic to identify whether human interactions can
be defined by an algorithm. Since all the interactions with the computer are defined by a
series of 1s and 0s, i.e., a <a 
 id="dx1-2001"></a>bit string, the interaction can be codified by an algorithm that
outputs the same bit string. Consequently, on first analysis, trying to computationally
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
distinguish human interaction from algorithm output seems impossible. If human
interaction is indistinguishable from algorithmic output, then it is not plausible human
interaction can surpass the No Free Lunch Theorem (NFLT). Such is the basic problem
addressed: How is it possible to <a 
 id="dx1-2002"></a>distinguish human interaction from algorithm
output?
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >       Even though it is always possible to codify a series of events in a finite domain after
the fact, the question is whether such codification is possible prior to the event&#8217;s
occurrence. A prior codification is not possible in all cases; otherwise, it violates the <a 
 id="dx1-2003"></a>halting
problem (<a 
href="#Xcover06:_elemen_of_infor_theor">Cover &amp; Thomas</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcover06:_elemen_of_infor_theor">2006</a>). This means the possibility of codifying a human&#8217;s
interaction after the interaction has occurred does not necessarily entail it can be
codified before the interaction. Consequently, it is possible that with the right
experimental design a human&#8217;s interaction can be distinguished from an algorithm
output.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Background</h3>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >The question is, what is the experimental design that can make the distinction between
human and algorithm? One approach is to use the NFLT. The theorem sets precise,
rigorous boundaries on the <a 
 id="dx1-3001"></a>mathematical capabilities of algorithms. Anything performing
outside of these boundaries is by logical necessity <a 
 id="dx1-3002"></a>non-algorithmic. To show <a 
 id="dx1-3003"></a>humans are
supra-computational, one need simply show they do not abide by the NFLT. Unfortunately,
such a demonstration may be impossible. The NFLT only applies across all problems
within a very small, specialized subset of problem types. As such, the NFLT is quite
difficult to apply in practice.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >       The <a 
 id="dx1-3004"></a>Almost No Free Lunch Theorem (ANFLT) (Droste, Jensen, &amp; Wegener, <a 
href="#Xdroste02:_optim_with_random_searc_heuris">2002</a>)
provides a solution. The theorem shows while the original NFLT does not apply to most
particular problem domains, the expected performance for most algorithms on many real
world problems does not vary significantly between algorithms. There is almost no free
lunch for a large portion of <a 
 id="dx1-3005"></a>real world problems.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >       The ANFLT result implies that given a search algorithm, as long as the algorithm is
selected independently of the problem, it is unlikely the choice of algorithm makes a
significant difference in search performance. Consequently, if <a 
 id="dx1-3006"></a>human interaction discovers a
solution significantly better than search algorithms, it is very likely the interaction was
non-algorithmic, and therefore supra-computational.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-1" id="enmark-1"><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></a></sup>
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >       According to William Dembski&#8217;s research on search algorithms (<a 
href="#Xdembski10:_searc_for_searc">Dembski &amp; Marks
II</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdembski10:_searc_for_searc">2010</a>), this supra-computational interaction takes the form of active information
creation. <a 
 id="dx1-3007"></a>Active information is the information necessary to improve a search algorithm&#8217;s
expected speed in finding a target solution beyond that of a random search. That is, with
more active information, fewer search queries are necessary to find the target
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
solution.
<a 
 id="dx1-3008"></a>
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >       Active information can be inserted into the algorithm from an existing source of
external information, or it may be created. In the case of the ANFLT, if the search
algorithm exhibits significant amounts of active information (i.e., finds a target much faster
than statistically expected), this information must be created since the conditions of the
ANFLT prohibit the information from being merely transferred from an external
source.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >       Since the information is created, it cannot come from either <a 
 id="dx1-3009"></a>chance or necessity, as
these sources can only degrade or transfer already existing information. Additionally, the
information is <a 
 id="dx1-3010"></a>specified by the degree it reduces the number of search queries to find the
target solution. Information that is neither the product of chance nor necessity and is
specified is complex specified information (CSI) (<a 
href="#Xdembski:_specif">Dembski</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdembski:_specif">2005</a>) as defined by Intelligent
Design Theory (IDT). Furthermore, IDT claims CSI can come from intelligent
agents.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40004"></a>Approach</h3>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >The approach in this study is to develop and test a general technique for integrating <a 
 id="dx1-4001"></a>human
interaction into search and optimization algorithms. By incorporating human interaction in
this way, it is possible to determine whether humans violate the algorithmic search
constraints of the ANFLT and consequently create CSI as predicted by IDT. This
technique&#8217;s implementation consists of a software framework that can be integrated with
many different kinds of algorithms and problems, including both single and multi-objective
problems. The technique is referred to as <a 
 id="dx1-4002"></a>CSI Collecting (CSIC) throughout the rest of this
paper.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >       CSIC is demonstrated as a proof of concept by using it to find public and private
keys for the <a 
 id="dx1-4003"></a>RSA <a 
 id="dx1-4004"></a>asymmetric cryptography system (<a 
href="#Xcormen01:_introd_to_algor">Cormen et&#x00A0;al.</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcormen01:_introd_to_algor">2001</a>). The
algorithm used in CSIC is a multi-objective genetic algorithm (Coello, Lamont, &amp;
Veldhuizen, <a 
href="#Xcoello07:_evolut_algor_for_solvin_multi_objec_probl">2007</a>). The human users will use CSIC through Amazon&#8217;s <a 
 id="dx1-4005"></a>Mechanical Turk
service.

 id="dx1-4007"></a>
<a 
 id="dx1-4008"></a>
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >       Success in the experiment is measured by the rate of solution improvement (fitness
increase) compared with problem information discovered, which is Fitness/Information or
FI for short. Solution improvement is measured by an objective function in the
genetic algorithm. The amount of problem information discovered is measured by
the number of solutions evaluated. The improvement due to human interaction
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
is compared to the improvement due to the genetic algorithm as measured by
FI.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >       Since the project is currently in the exploratory stage, the comparison
is informal. It is assumed the algorithm discovers problem domain information
at an exponentially greater rate compared to human agents. Consequently, any
greater or equivalent improvement of fitness by the human agents compared to the
algorithm produces a very high FI value in favor of the human agents. Thus, the
comparison between human agents and the genetic algorithm is based purely on fitness
increase.

<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The general technique used is as follows. A standard <a 
 id="dx1-5001"></a><a 
 id="dx1-5002"></a>multi-objective genetic algorithm is
used, a type of <a 
 id="dx1-5003"></a>stochastic global search algorithm (Figure <a 
href="#x1-5005r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stochastic_global_solution_search --></a>). A genetic algorithm takes a
set of solutions, measures how good each solution is according to some fitness valuation
function, varies the solutions to generate a new set using variation operators such as
mutation and crossover, and then from both sets of solutions selects an output set
according to some criteria. The algorithm then reiterates this process on each subsequent
output set until a stopping criteria is reached. The <a

the algorithm as fixed length bit strings. The functions <span

solution is represented symbolically, so the user has no contextual clues as to what
the problem is that he is attempting to solve. This is done in order to create a

and algorithms. The only information to which the user has access is similarities
between solutions (as shown by similarities in symbols) and the value of each
solution. Once the user selects a set of solutions, he picks the type of variation
operators to apply to the solutions and then presses &#8220;GO&#8221; to have the algorithm, as
shown in Figure <a

unnecessary to add active information to the search since the user is an intelligent
agent.

far.

<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >The guided genetic algorithm received 500 human inputs from the Amazon Mechanical
Turk service. The human input contributed 1 out of 18 superior solutions found (Figure <a

The one solution found by a human was also found by the algorithm. However, the logs

methodological factors, as will be discussed in Section <a

<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >While the methodology for CSIC is still in its infancy, and its efficacy has yet to be
demonstrated, there are also theoretical objections to the concept that have been or could
be raised. The following section attempts to provide answers to these objections. In all of
these objections the assumption is made that CSI, or active information, cannot be created
by algorithmic sources. Additionally, it is also assumed that active information is a
subcategory of CSI.
</p><!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
       <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-110007.1"></a>Objection: Human intelligence is an algorithm with already high amounts of
CSI</h4>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >One objection to this methodology is that human intelligence is an algorithm
that <span 
class="cmti-12">already contains </span>high amounts of CSI, especially since the ANFLT does
not rule out the possibility that a proximate algorithmic information source is
available. It might be the case that human minds are highly tuned algorithms for
particular difficult problem domains. Consequently, humans will outperform all
current state of the art algorithms in these domains, but this does not preclude
human intelligence being algorithmic. This objection holds even in the case of the
ANFLT.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >       Such an objection is valid. The CSIC experiment cannot categorically rule out the
possibility that human intelligence is a kind of algorithm. However, CSIC can provide an
<a 
 id="dx1-11001"></a>inference to the best explanation between two competing hypotheses. The first hypothesis
asserts that the proximate cause, human intelligence, created the information, while
the second hypothesis states that a more remote intelligent agent created the
information.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >       To determine which hypothesis is better supported by a positive result in the CSIC
experiment, the <a 
 id="dx1-11002"></a>principle of minimal CSI creation is proposed. The principle is analogous
to Ockham&#8217;s Razor. This principle states in the case where the creation of CSI
is presupposed, the explanation relying on the least amount of CSI creation is
preferred.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >       The first hypothesis relies on less CSI creation since the human only creates
CSI for a particular problem instance. Hypothesis two requires the creation of
enormous amounts of CSI covering all possible problem instances the human might
encounter.
</p><!--l. 178--><p class="indent" >       Consequently, while the CSIC experiment does not rule out algorithmic human
intelligence, it does show that supra-computational human intelligence is the best
explanation of a positive result.

</p>
       <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-120007.2"></a>Objection: Supra-computation does not imply effectiveness on all
problems</h4>
<!--l. 181--><p class="noindent" >Another objection to this methodology is that even if human intelligence is
supra-computational, this does not imply that it is necessarily effective on all
possible problems. It could be performing supra-computational actions which
are still limited in scope and thus preventing its use in arbitrary problems. This
objection is also valid. Consequently, the question is, in which problems do humans
demonstrate supra-computational abilities? One way to answer this question is
experimentally, by having humans work with different problems and seeing in which
instances supra-computational abilities are exhibited. This is the intent of the
CSIC experiment. There is no presumption supra-computational abilities will be
demonstrated, only a presumption that it is possible to detect such abilities within the
experiment.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >       Research by <a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_using_turin_oracl_in_cognit_model">Bartlett</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xbartlett11:_using_turin_oracl_in_cognit_model">2014b</a>) suggests that even if humans do demonstrate
supra-computation, such a capability may depend on existing information, such as axioms
about the problem domain. If true, then the almost complete removal of context in CSIC
may render the user incapable of contributing active information to the search
algorithm.

</p>
       <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-130007.3"></a>Objection: Supra-computation is only exhibited in context dependent
interactions</h4>
<!--l. 187--><p class="noindent" >This objection states that the removal of almost all context in CSIC is a methodological
problem because experience seems to indicate that supra-computation only occurs within
situational contexts. A solution can only be created when the problem is contextually
understood.
</p><!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >       However, the observation is not always true. One scenario similar to CSIC where
information is created is learning to read. When people learn to read a language, they are
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
presented with a string of symbols without an inherent context. They learn the meaning of
the symbols through external responses, such as getting affirmation when mapping the
symbols to the correct action or object.

       <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-140007.4"></a>Objection: Supra-computation requires holistic reasoning</h4>
<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >This objection states that in order to solve a problem, the person solving must not only
know the problem, but also understand why the problem exists. Since the user of CSIC
neither knows nor understands the problem at hand, he will be unable to solve the
problem.
</p><!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >       There is a degree of holism available in CSIC, as the user can see many solutions
and valuations and thus look for overarching patterns. The user can understand at a very
abstract level the characteristics of good and bad solutions.

keys</h4>
<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >This objection is quite likely correct. However, even if correct, if human interaction
improves the solutions beyond the algorithmic limits, then the experiment achieves a
positive result. On the other hand, better choices of problems, such as well understood
pedagogical problems, would greatly improve the experimental design.
</p><!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >       RSA cracking was chosen for this experimental investigation mostly because the
applicability of solving this problem is much easier to explain to a lay audience than more
pedagogical problems. Additionally, a successful result for this problem would have direct,
groundbreaking relevance for software engineering.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8   </span> <a 
 id="x1-160008"></a>Future Work</h3>
<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >While the essential methodology and implementation of CSIC have now been created and
tested, many areas of improvement remain. Additionally CSIC must be compared to
alternatives to see if CSIC is truly effective and beneficial.
</p><!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >       The main potential area of improvement is in verifying whether the Amazon Turk
input is truly human generated and whether the users are actually trying to find patterns.
Users have been known to script Amazon Turk jobs, and without such verification in this
case it is not possible to know with certainty whether the input is human generated.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
When the logs from this experiment were analyzed, it turns out the Amazon Turk
users were just selecting all the solutions and not trying to find patterns in the
solutions. To provide a cleaner environment for experimentation, the guided and
unguided algorithms should be separated. Additionally, the data logging needs to be
time-stamped.
</p><!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >       The algorithm and problem used in the experiment can be improved in
numerous ways. Pedagogical problems and algorithms should be used to compare the
effectiveness of CSIC to the current state of the art. Practical problems where search
algorithms have already proven effective should be explored to see if CSIC can provide
additional benefit. CSIC should also be compared to contextualized human-powered
search algorithms, such as Foldit, to see how the addition of context affects search
effectiveness.
</p><!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >       Different forms of motivation should be explored. The Amazon Turk interface relies
on a financial motivation, which motivates users to cut corners and perform the task in the
fastest way possible. Such motivation does not encourage users to find extremely
good solutions. If the interface is in the form of an entertaining game, users are
better encouraged to find good solutions. Furthermore, a simplified explanation of
the cutting edge relevance of their work provides an intrinsic motivation, and
encourages innovation as demonstrated by significant user innovation in <a
