<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >One of the most remarkable characteristics of living organisms is their ability to
self-replicate. There are many forms and manifestations of self-replication. These forms
vary from the simplest, single-celled organisms to a wide range of living forms to the most
complex organisms, including humans and other mammals.
<a 
 id="dx1-1001"></a>
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >       One of the most intriguing questions that ordinary people, engineers, scientists, and
philosophers have obsessed over for centuries is how life on Earth originated and is able to
create descendants that look like their parents. Many researchers and scientists have
invested tremendous resources in trying to identify a plausible natural means by which the
simplest forms of life may have been created from inanimate matter. They have tried to
identify, and hopefully reproduce, a set of events and circumstances that somehow puts
together the basic elements of the simplest entity to replicate and thus become a living
organism.
<a 
 id="dx1-1002"></a>
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >       The goal of this study is to use an engineering approach to develop insights into the
internal design of a simplest possible self-replicator (SSR). The SSR is defined for the
purpose of this study as an autonomous artifact that has the ability to obtain material
input from its environment, grow, and create an exact replica of itself. The replica should
&#8220;inherit&#8221; the ability from its &#8220;mother&#8221; SSR to create, in its turn, an exact copy of
itself.
<a 
 id="dx1-1003"></a>
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >       It is important to observe that this simple definition of the SSR accurately mimics
the characteristic behavior of many single-celled organisms, at least from the
perspective of their ability to self-reproduce. In particular, they are autonomous in
regards to their ability to ingest materials from their environment, to use the
ingested materials for growth and production of internal energy, and to produce an
identical copy of themselves, usually through a two-step process of cloning and
division.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >       Part&#x00A0;1 and Part&#x00A0;2 of this paper will analyze the process of self-replication as though
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
it is a preliminary study for a research lab tasked to design and build an artificial SSR from
scratch. The objectives of this study are as follows:

      with  specific  characterization  of  the  role  of  each  functional  component,  its

<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >Two reasonable assumptions will be made about the SSR. The first assumption is that the
SSR is comprised of an enclosure that has the role of separating the SSR from its
environment. Secondly, the surface of this enclosure has openings that are used to accept
good substances into the SSR&#8212;raw materials and raw parts from the SSR environment.
These openings will be called <span 
class="cmti-12">input gateways</span>. There are also openings used by the
SSR to expel from inside the SSR refuse materials and parts that result from
certain transformation/fabrication processes. These openings will be called <span

<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >There is one primary question for the input gateways: Are all the raw materials and raw
parts that exist or touch the outside of the enclosure good for the SSR processes?
Certainly, they are not. The SSR and its input gateways must feature some ability to select
or reject substances, materials, and parts that are outside the SSR interior and determine
whether they should enter. For this paper, this feature of the SSR will be called the <span

<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >The next point to be considered is how the SSR will know which are good raw materials
and parts and which are bad materials and parts. The SSR must possess a catalog of good
raw materials and parts that will be the informational basis on which the input gateways
will open or stay closed. This catalog will be referred to as the <span

<a

<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >The next issue is how the SSR will recognize and accurately identify a material or
part at an input gateway as good or bad. That is not a trivial ability. The SSR
needs a way to determine the nature of the materials and parts to which its input
gateways are exposed. This ability may be supported by a set of material probing
procedures and processes. This SSR ability will be called the <span 
class="cmti-12">materials and parts</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">identification function</span>. The complexity of this capability can be compared to the
probes on the Martian rover that were used to analyze soil samples for particular
compounds.

parts and components</h4>
<!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >An input gateway, assisted by the raw materials and parts identification function,
determines that a piece of raw material is one of the good materials recorded in the good
raw materials and parts catalog. This piece is going to be admitted into the SSR and
transported to a particular place for processing or possibly to a temporary storage location
followed by processing. In order to do this successfully, the SSR needs to tag or label this
piece so that its nature, once determined at the input gateway, is available for
subsequent processing stations or storage stations in the SSR. Therefore, any raw
material or part that is allowed to enter the SSR, once its nature is identified, is
immediately tagged or labeled using a system similar to the bar codes or RFIDs
(radio-frequency identification) where the code used is one of the codes in the catalog of
raw materials and parts. This systematic labeling and tagging of all accepted materials

its &#8220;fabrication recipe&#8221; requires 2 raw parts of type X and 4 raw parts of type Y. The
SSR will need to be able to coordinate the input gateways to admit prior to the
cloning process required quantities of parts X and Y, creating stock in a SSR stock
room so that the fabrication of component A can go smoothly. This will allow the
fabrication of the component to depend less on the available raw parts at any given
moment at the enclosure input gateways. This SSR ability will be referred to as the
<span

processes within the SSR to gather information prior to fabrication regarding what
raw materials, raw parts, or fabricated parts are needed. It will then command

specific means of transport, such as conduits, avenues, conveyors, etc., that are
adequate for the particular elements that are being transported and the particular

the material or part and place it in a specified position in the stock room or place it

This function allows the SSR to assemble parts into components and assemblies

same coin, it makes sense to see them as distinct functions where the fabrication
function creates new parts from raw materials and raw parts through special
processes (e.g., metal machining) while the assemblage function puts fabricated parts
together into more and more complex assemblies. The assemblage function may be
needed, for example, to erect and expand the scaffolding and the enclosure during
SSR growth along with creating assemblies of smaller components and parts.

<a 
 id="dx1-23001"></a>
<!--l. 566--><p class="noindent" >Another issue in developing the artificial SSR is that the SSR has variable geometry. The
SSR has variable geometry because, first, the mature SSR must grow in volume and
enclosure surface during the cloning phase to make space in its interior for the growing
clone. Second, the geometry changes even more radically when the division phase starts
and culminates with the complete division of the original SSR in both the mother SSR and
the daughter SSR.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 574--><p class="indent" >       The SSR variable geometry presents many considerations and challenges
that must be carefully considered by the SSR design and by the hypothetical
implementation of the artificial SSR. The first consideration is the structure and
composition (texture) of the SSR. This must be designed to allow the following:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Surface area growth as the SSR interior grows in volume during the cloning
      phase. This may require a design that allows selective insertion of new enclosure
      parts/elements in between existing parts/elements and a way to link or connect
      each new element with its neighboring elements.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Insertion of new input gateways and output gateways while the enclosure grows.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Division of the enclosure into two separate enclosures (one for the mother SSR
      and one for the daughter SSR) with each enclosure carrying its separate sets of
      input and output gateways, scaffolding, and interior elements.</li></ul>
<!--l. 592--><p class="indent" >       Next, special design provisions must be made for the interior SSR scaffolding. The
SSR scaffolding is made of structural elements (e.g., pylons, walls, supports, connectors,
etc.) that are needed to maintain the three-dimensional structure and integrity of the
enclosure and of the SSR interior space(s). The scaffolding design and its elements need to
be conceived such that, first, the scaffolding elements may change size as the interior of the
SSR grows (during cloning) or shrinks (during division); second, the spacing between
scaffolding elements and their connectors may also grow or shrink (during cloning or
division phases). Finally, the design of the SSR must also make provisions for the
growth, variable geometry, and dynamic restructuring and re-linking of any SSR
transport, conduits, paths or communication lines during the cloning and division
phases.
</p><!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >       The variable geometry means that the SSR design must make specific, detailed
provisions for the entirety of its spatial evolution. This includes all geometrical definition
points or trajectories (in the x, y, and z axes) of all variable elements of the SSR enclosure,
scaffolding and interior. These spatial trajectories need to be harmoniously and coherently
coordinated with all fabrication and assemblage steps of the cloning and division phases.

fabrication and assemblage functions to build a particular component of the daughter
clone. In this circumstance, the fabrication and the assemblage functions operate as
execution centers for the command. When the fabrication of the requested component
is completed by the fabrication function, it will send a specifically formatted

the specific command for the fabrication of the specific element was successfully
completed. Within the same example scenario, the fabrication function will send, in its

<!--l. 813--><p class="noindent" >Various types of information catalogs (databases or repositories) that together make up the
information base of the SSR have already been presented. This section contains a list of all
of the types of information catalogs identified thus far. It is quite probable that after a
more in-depth analysis of the topic, there may be the need for additional types of
information catalogs.
</p><!--l. 818--><p class="indent" >       The SSR information catalogs need to thoroughly, systematically, and coherently
capture all information describing in detail each element of the SSR during its full
life-cycle, all relationships between these elements captured in construction plans (body
plans), and all fabrication and assemblage procedures and processes.
</p><!--l. 824--><p class="indent" >       This requires making certain simplifying assumptions in order to make the
presentation of ideas easier to understand. This means that every piece of data or
information that the SSR design must capture cannot be fully dissected here. A real
information repository not only contains conceptual lists of tables (catalogs) of items of the
same nature but also lists of the various relationships that exist between the items in
different tables (catalogs). For example, there are certain relationships between the items in
the catalog of raw materials and the items in the catalog of the bill of materials. There are
different sets of relationships between the entries in the catalog of the construction plans
and the entries in the catalog of the bill of materials and the entries in the catalog of
processes. For now, this is just a list of the core catalogs that have been identified so
far:

<!--l. 861--><p class="noindent" >This part provides an abstract description of the minimal core components, processes,
information stores, and structural requirements of an artificial self-replicating system.
Part&#x00A0;2 will cover physical considerations for implementing such a design, and Part&#x00A0;3 will
cover speculative ideas for what the existence of self-replicative processes in nature
indicates on the larger scale.
