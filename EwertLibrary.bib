Black holes might be 'logic gates' recomputing the 'lost information' from incoming 'signals' from outside their event horizons into outgoing 'signals' representing evaporative or radiative decay 'products' of the reconfiguration process of the black hole quantum logic 'gate'. Apparent local imbalances in the information flow can be corrected by including the effects of the coupling of the vacuum 'reservoir' of information as part of the total information involved in any evolutionary process. In this way perhaps the 'vacuum' computes the future of the observable universe.},

abstract = {This paper shows an example of how simulated evolution can be applied to a practical optimization problem, and more specifically, how the addition of co-evolving parasites can improve the procedure by preventing the system from sticking at local maxima. Firstly an optimization procedure based on simulated evolution and its implementation on a parallel computer are described. Then an application of this system to the problem of generating minimal sorting networks is described. Finally it is shown how the introduction of a species of co-evolving parasites improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedure.},
annote = {Quotes: Whether or not it will find a good solution will depend on the distribution of solutions within the space. (speaking of simulated evolution and other dominan-independent search procedures)
        
How well this works obviously depends on the distribution of solutions in the space. The types of fitness spaces for which simulated evolution produces good results are not well understood, but one important type of space for which it works is a space that is independently a good domain for hill climbining in each dimension
        
One difficulty with this approach is that even if the solution is sin the space of smal networks, the easiest paths to the solution may not be. It may be easier, for example, to produce a short correct ntwork by optimizing a slightly longer correct network than by fixing a bug in a short uncorrect network. For this reason, we have taken advantage of the diploid representation of a genotype to allow longer networks to be generated as intermediate solutions.
        
Because most of the known minimal 16-input networks begin with the same pattern of 32 exchanges, the gene pool is initialized to be homozygous for these exchanges.

abstract = {The multiple destination routing (MDR) problem can be formulated as finding a minimal cost tree which contains designated source and multiple destination nodes so that certain constraints in a given communication network are satisfied. This is a typical NP-hard problem, and therefore only heuristic algorithms are of practical value. As a first step, a new genetic algorithm is developed to solve the MDR problems without constraints. It is based on the transformation of the underlying network of an MDR problem into its distance complete form, a natural chromosome representation of a minimal spanning tree (an individual), and a completely new computation of the fitness of individual. Compared with the known genetic algorithms and heuristic algorithms for the same problem, the proposed algorithm has several advantages. First, it guarantees convergence to an optimal solution with probability one. Second, not only are the resultant solutions all feasible, the solution quality is also much higher than that obtained by the other methods (indeed, in almost every case in our simulations, the algorithm can find the optimal solution of the problem). Third, the algorithm is of low computational complexity, and this can be decreased dramatically as the number of destination nodes in the problem increases. The simulation studies for the sparse and dense networks all demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly robust and very efficient in the sense of yielding high-quality solutions},

In asexual populations, however, clones that carry such alternative beneficial mutations compete with one another and, thereby, interfere with the expected progression of a given mutation to fixation. From theoretical exploration of such 'clonal interference', we have derived (1) a fixation probability for beneficial mutations, (2) an expected substitution rate, (3) an expected coefficient of selection for realized substitutions, (4) an expected rate of fitness increase, (5) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves polymorphic frequency (> or = 1\%), and (6) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves majority status. Based on (2) and (3), we were able to estimate the beneficial mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects from changes in mean fitness in an evolving E. coli population.},

abstract = {Dynamic Steiner tree problem (DST) is described as the multipoint routing problem in the communication networks, in which a set of nodes and the set of Steiner vertices in the connection is changing with time. The problem is based on the Steiner tree problem on graphs. In the DST problem, the Steiner minimal tree cost is changing with time because the requests of the Steiner vertices or weights of graph edge are changing with time. We propose an online genetic algorithm (OLGA) to solve this problem. OLGA is different from general GA in that it does not evaluate individual against a fixed object, since the object changes with time. An individual in GA is expressed by the gene of the graph nodes. As an adapt method, the Prim algorithm is used to calculate the value of the cost of the graph nodes. In order to make our algorithm robust, we applied the B-problem set from Beasley (1990), thus the problems are based on the B-problem set. From experimental simulations, we show that the OLGA is robust to calculate this kind of problems},

abstract = {The extent to which a population diverges from its ancestor through adaptive evolution depends on variation supplied by novel beneficial mutations. Extending earlier work, recent theory makes two predictions that seem to be robust to biological details: the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations before selection should be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning it is always exponential regardless of the fitness rank of the wild-type allele. Here we test these predictions by assaying the fitness of 665 independently derived single-step mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a range of environments. We show that the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential despite marked variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across environments. These results suggest that the initial step in adaptive evolution--the production of novel beneficial mutants from which selection sorts--is very general, being characterized by an approximately exponential distribution with many mutations of small effect and few of large effect. We also document substantial variation in the pleiotropic costs of antibiotic resistance, a result that may have implications for strategies aimed at eliminating resistant pathogens in animal and human populations.},

abstract = {The sharpened No-Free-Lunch-theorem (NFL-theorem) states that, regardless of the performance measure, the performance of all optimization algorithms averaged uniformly over any finite set F of functions is equal if and only if F is closed under permutation (c.u.p.). In this paper, we first summarize some consequences of this theorem, which have been proven recently: The number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the total number of possible subsets. In particular, problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be c.u.p. The average number of evaluations needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimal) solution can be calculated independent of the optimization algorithm in certain scenarios. Second, as the main result, the NFL-theorem is extended. Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL-results to hold are given for arbitrary distributions of target functions. This yields the most general NFL-theorem for optimization presented so far.},

abstract = {How do genetic systems gain information by evolutionary processes? Answering this question precisely requires a robust, quantitative measure of information. Fortunately, 50 years ago Claude Shannon defined information as a decrease in the uncertainty of a receiver. For molecular systems, uncertainty is closely related to entropy and hence has clear connections to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. These aspects of information theory have allowed the development of a straightforward and practical method of measuring information in genetic control systems. Here this method is used to observe information gain in the binding sites for an artificial 'protein' in a computer simulation of evolution. The simulation begins with zero information and, as in naturally occurring genetic systems, the information measured in the fully evolved binding sites is close to that needed to locate the sites in the genome. The transition is rapid, demonstrating that information gain can occur by punctuated equilibrium.},

Accumulating studies on this topic have reported surprising cases of convergent evolution at the molecular level, ranging from gene families being recurrently recruited to identical amino acid replacements in distant lineages. Together, these different examples of genetic convergence suggest that molecular evolution is in some cases strongly constrained by a combination of limited genetic material suitable for new functions and a restricted number of substitutions that can confer specific enzymatic properties. We discuss approaches for gaining further insights into the causes of genetic convergence and their potential contribution to our understanding of how the genetic background determines the evolvability of complex organismal traits.},

abstract = {Conservation of information (COI) popularized by the no free lunch theorem is a great leveler of search algorithms, showing that on average no search outperforms any other. Yet in practice some searches appear to outperform others. In consequence, some have questioned the significance of COI to the performance of search algorithms. An underlying foundation of COI is Bernoulli's Principle of Insufficient Reason(PrOIR) which imposes of a uniform distribution on a search space in the absence of all prior knowledge about the search target or the search space structure. The assumption is conserved under mapping. If the probability of finding a target in a search space is p, then the problem of finding the target in any subset of the search space is p. More generally, all some-to-many mappings of a uniform search space result in a new search space where the chance of doing better than p is 50-50. Consequently the chance of doing worse is 50-50. This result can be viewed as a confirming property of COI. To properly assess the significance of the COI for search, one must completely identify the precise sources of information that affect search performance. This discussion leads to resolution of the seeming conflict between COI and the observation that some search algorithms perform well on a large class of problems.},

abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of adaptive evolution in asexual (clonal) populations. The classical 'periodic selection' model of clonal evolution assumed that beneficial mutations are very rare and therefore substitute unfettered into populations as occasional, isolated events. Newer models allow for the possibility that beneficial mutations are sufficiently common to coexist and compete for fixation within populations. Experimental evolution studies in microbes provide empirical support for stochastic models in which both selection and mutation are strong effects and clones compete for fixation; however, the relative importance of competition among clones bearing mutations of different selective effects versus competition among clones bearing multiple mutations remains unresolved. We provide some new theoretical results, moreover, suggesting that population dynamics consistent with the periodic selection model can arise even in a deterministic model that can accommodate a very high beneficial mutation rate.},

abstract = {A long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory has been whether it can explain the origin of complex organismal features. We examined this issue using digital organisms--computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. These findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms instruct sophisticated biological organization. Three qualitative kinds of sequence complexity exist: random (RSC), ordered (OSC), and functional (FSC). FSC alone provides algorithmic instruction. Random and Ordered Sequence Complexities lie at opposite ends of the same bi-directional sequence complexity vector. Randomness in sequence space is defined by a lack of Kolmogorov algorithmic compressibility. A sequence is compressible because it contains redundant order and patterns. Law-like cause-and-effect determinism produces highly compressible order. Such forced ordering precludes both information retention and freedom of selection so critical to algorithmic programming and control. Functional Sequence Complexity requires this added programming dimension of uncoerced selection at successive decision nodes in the string. Shannon information theory measures the relative degrees of RSC and OSC. Shannon information theory cannot measure FSC. FSC is invariably associated with all forms of complex biofunction, including biochemical pathways, cycles, positive and negative feedback regulation, and homeostatic metabolism. The algorithmic programming of FSC, not merely its aperiodicity, accounts for biological organization. No empirical evidence exists of either RSC of OSC ever having produced a single instance of sophisticated biological organization. Organization invariably manifests FSC rather than successive random events (RSC) or low-informational self-ordering phenomena (OSC).},

A number of “no free lunch” (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori “head-to-head” minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

In this paper, we first summarize some consequences of this theorem, which have been proven recently: The average number of evaluations needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimal) solution can be calculated; the number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the overall number of possible subsets; and problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be c.u.p. Second, as the main result, the NFL-theorem is extended. Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL-results to hold are given for arbitrary, non-uniform distributions of target functions. This yields the most general NFL-theorem for optimization presented so far.},

@article{Axe2004,
abstract = {Proteins employ a wide variety of folds to perform their biological functions. How are these folds first acquired? An important step toward answering this is to obtain an estimate of the overall prevalence of sequences adopting functional folds. Since tertiary structure is needed for a typical enzyme active site to form, one way to obtain this estimate is to measure the prevalence of sequences supporting a working active site. Although the immense number of sequence combinations makes wholly random sampling unfeasible, two key simplifications may provide a solution. First, given the importance of hydrophobic interactions to protein folding, it seems likely that the sample space can be restricted to sequences carrying the hydropathic signature of a known fold. Second, because folds are stabilized by the cooperative action of many local interactions distributed throughout the structure, the overall problem of fold stabilization may be viewed reasonably as a collection of coupled local problems. This enables the difficulty of the whole problem to be assessed by assessing the difficulty of several smaller problems. Using these simplifications, the difficulty of specifying a working beta-lactamase domain is assessed here. An alignment of homologous domain sequences is used to deduce the pattern of hydropathic constraints along chains that form the domain fold. Starting with a weakly functional sequence carrying this signature, clusters of ten side-chains within the fold are replaced randomly, within the boundaries of the signature, and tested for function. The prevalence of low-level function in four such experiments indicates that roughly one in 10(64) signature-consistent sequences forms a working domain. Combined with the estimated prevalence of plausible hydropathic patterns (for any fold) and of relevant folds for particular functions, this implies the overall prevalence of sequences performing a specific function by any domain-sized fold may be as low as 1 in 10(77), adding to the body of evidence that functional folds require highly extraordinary sequences.},

abstract = {Epistasis has substantial impacts on evolution, in particular, the rate of adaptation. We generated combinations of beneficial mutations that arose in a lineage during rapid adaptation of a bacterium whose growth depended on a newly introduced metabolic pathway. The proportional selective benefit for three of the four loci consistently decreased when they were introduced onto more fit backgrounds. These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them. These results provide the first evidence that patterns of epistasis may differ for within- and between-gene interactions during adaptation and that diminishing returns epistasis contributes to the consistent observation of decelerating fitness gains during adaptation.},

The classical 'periodic selection' model of clonal evolution assumed that beneficial mutations are very rare and therefore substitute unfettered into populations as occasional, isolated events. Newer models allow for the possibility that beneficial mutations are sufficiently common to coexist and compete for fixation within populations. Experimental evolution studies in microbes provide empirical support for stochastic models in which both selection and mutation are strong effects and clones compete for fixation; however, the relative importance of competition among clones bearing mutations of different selective effects versus competition among clones bearing multiple mutations remains unresolved. We provide some new theoretical results, moreover, suggesting that population dynamics consistent with the periodic selection model can arise even in a deterministic model that can accommodate a very high beneficial mutation rate.},

abstract = {The extent to which a population diverges from its ancestor through adaptive evolution depends on variation supplied by novel beneficial mutations. Extending earlier work, recent theory makes two predictions that seem to be robust to biological details: the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations before selection should be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning it is always exponential regardless of the fitness rank of the wild-type allele. Here we test these predictions by assaying the fitness of 665 independently derived single-step mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a range of environments. We show that the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential despite marked variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across environments. These results suggest that the initial step in adaptive evolution--the production of novel beneficial mutants from which selection sorts--is very general, being characterized by an approximately exponential distribution with many mutations of small effect and few of large effect. We also document substantial variation in the pleiotropic costs of antibiotic resistance, a result that may have implications for strategies aimed at eliminating resistant pathogens in animal and human populations.},

abstract = {Epistatic interactions between mutations play a prominent role in evolutionary theories. Many studies have found that epistasis is widespread, but they have rarely considered beneficial mutations. We analyzed the effects of epistasis on fitness for the first five mutations to fix in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Epistasis depended on the effects of the combined mutations--the larger the expected benefit, the more negative the epistatic effect. Epistasis thus tended to produce diminishing returns with genotype fitness, although interactions involving one particular mutation had the opposite effect. These data support models in which negative epistasis contributes to declining rates of adaptation over time. Sign epistasis was rare in this genome-wide study, in contrast to its prevalence in an earlier study of mutations in a single gene.},

@article{Yang2002,
abstract = {Polymorphisms in an ancestral population can cause conflicts between gene trees and the species tree. Such conflicts can be used to estimate ancestral population sizes when data from multiple loci are available. In this article I extend previous work for estimating ancestral population sizes to analyze sequence data from three species under a finite-site nucleotide substitution model. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayes methods are implemented for joint estimation of the two speciation dates and the two population size parameters. Both methods account for uncertainties in the gene tree due to few informative sites at each locus and make an efficient use of information in the data. The Bayes algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) enjoys a computational advantage over ML and also provides a framework for incorporating prior information about the parameters. The methods are applied to a data set of 53 nuclear noncoding contigs from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla published by Chen and Li. Estimates of the effective population size for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees by both ML and Bayes methods are approximately 12,000-21,000, comparable to estimates for modern humans, and do not support the notion of a dramatic size reduction in early human populations. Estimates published previously from the same data are several times larger and appear to be biased due to methodological deficiency. The divergence between humans and chimpanzees is dated at approximately 5.2 million years ago and the gorilla divergence 1.1-1.7 million years earlier. The analysis suggests that typical data sets contain useful information about the ancestral population sizes and that it is advantageous to analyze data of several species simultaneously.},

abstract = {Whenever an asexual viral population evolves by adapting to new environmental conditions, beneficial mutations, the ultimate cause of adaptation, are randomly produced and then fixed in the population. The larger the population size and the higher the mutation rate, the more beneficial mutations can be produced per unit time. With the usually high mutation rate of RNA viruses and in a large enough population, several beneficial mutations could arise at the same time but in different genetic backgrounds, and if the virus is asexual, they will never be brought together through recombination. Thus, the best of these genotypes must outcompete each other on their way to fixation. This competition among beneficial mutations has the effect of slowing the overall rate of adaptation. This phenomenon is known as clonal interference. Clonal interference predicts a speed limit for adaptation as the population size increases. In the present report, by varying the size of evolving vesicular stomatitis virus populations, we found evidence clearly demonstrating this speed limit and thus indicating that clonal interference might be an important factor modulating the rate of adaptation to an in vitro cell system. Several evolutionary and epidemiological implications of the clonal interference model applied to RNA viruses are discussed.},

abstract = {The extent and nature of epistatic interactions between mutations are issues of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. However, they are difficult to study and their influence on adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we use a systems-level approach to examine epistatic interactions that arose during the evolution of Escherichia coli in a defined environment. We used expression arrays to compare the effect on global patterns of gene expression of deleting a central regulatory gene, crp. Effects were measured in two lineages that had independently evolved for 20,000 generations and in their common ancestor. We found that deleting crp had a much more dramatic effect on the expression profile of the two evolved lines than on the ancestor. Because the sequence of the crp gene was unchanged during evolution, these differences indicate epistatic interactions between crp and mutations at other loci that accumulated during evolution. Moreover, a striking degree of parallelism was observed between the two independently evolved lines; 115 genes that were not crp-dependent in the ancestor became dependent on crp in both evolved lines. An analysis of changes in crp dependence of well-characterized regulons identified a number of regulatory genes as candidates for harboring beneficial mutations that could account for these parallel expression changes. Mutations within three of these genes have previously been found and shown to contribute to fitness. Overall, these findings indicate that epistasis has been important in the adaptive evolution of these lines, and they provide new insight into the types of genetic changes through which epistasis can evolve. More generally, we demonstrate that expression profiles can be profitably used to investigate epistatic interactions.},

Secondly, search algorithms are often applied to program induction and it is suggested that NFL does not hold due to the universal nature of the mapping between program space and functionality space. Finally, NFL and combinatorial problems are examined. When evaluating a candidate solution, it can be discarded without being fully examined. A stronger version of NFL is established for this class of problems where the goal is to minimize a quantity.},

H\"{a}ggstr\"{o}m (Biology and Philosophy 22:217-230, 2007) argued that the NFL theorems are not relevant for biological evolution at all, since the assumptions of the NFL theorems are not met. Although I agree with H\"{a}ggstr\"{o}m (Biology and Philosophy 22:217-230, 2007), in this article I argue that the NFL theorems should be interpreted as dealing with an extreme case within a much broader context. This broader context is in fact relevant for scientific research of certain evolutionary processes; not in the sense that the theorems can be used to draw conclusions about any intelligent design inference, but in the sense that it helps us to interpret computer simulations of evolutionary processes. As a result of this discussion, I will argue that from simulations, we do not learn much about how complexity arises in the universe. This position is in contrast with certain claims in the literature that I will discuss.},

The classical 'periodic selection' model of clonal evolution assumed that beneficial mutations are very rare and therefore substitute unfettered into populations as occasional, isolated events. Newer models allow for the possibility that beneficial mutations are sufficiently common to coexist and compete for fixation within populations. Experimental evolution studies in microbes provide empirical support for stochastic models in which both selection and mutation are strong effects and clones compete for fixation; however, the relative importance of competition among clones bearing mutations of different selective effects versus competition among clones bearing multiple mutations remains unresolved. We provide some new theoretical results, moreover, suggesting that population dynamics consistent with the periodic selection model can arise even in a deterministic model that can accommodate a very high beneficial mutation rate.},

abstract = {Dynamic Steiner tree problem (DST) is described as the multipoint routing problem in the communication networks, in which a set of nodes and the set of Steiner vertices in the connection is changing with time. The problem is based on the Steiner tree problem on graphs. In the DST problem, the Steiner minimal tree cost is changing with time because the requests of the Steiner vertices or weights of graph edge are changing with time. We propose an online genetic algorithm (OLGA) to solve this problem. OLGA is different from general GA in that it does not evaluate individual against a fixed object, since the object changes with time. An individual in GA is expressed by the gene of the graph nodes. As an adapt method, the Prim algorithm is used to calculate the value of the cost of the graph nodes. In order to make our algorithm robust, we applied the B-problem set from Beasley (1990), thus the problems are based on the B-problem set. From experimental simulations, we show that the OLGA is robust to calculate this kind of problems},

abstract = {The multiple destination routing (MDR) problem can be formulated as finding a minimal cost tree which contains designated source and multiple destination nodes so that certain constraints in a given communication network are satisfied. This is a typical NP-hard problem, and therefore only heuristic algorithms are of practical value. As a first step, a new genetic algorithm is developed to solve the MDR problems without constraints. It is based on the transformation of the underlying network of an MDR problem into its distance complete form, a natural chromosome representation of a minimal spanning tree (an individual), and a completely new computation of the fitness of individual. Compared with the known genetic algorithms and heuristic algorithms for the same problem, the proposed algorithm has several advantages. First, it guarantees convergence to an optimal solution with probability one. Second, not only are the resultant solutions all feasible, the solution quality is also much higher than that obtained by the other methods (indeed, in almost every case in our simulations, the algorithm can find the optimal solution of the problem). Third, the algorithm is of low computational complexity, and this can be decreased dramatically as the number of destination nodes in the problem increases. The simulation studies for the sparse and dense networks all demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly robust and very efficient in the sense of yielding high-quality solutions},

abstract = {The functional effects of most amino acid replacements accumulated during molecular evolution are unknown, because most are not observed naturally and the possible combinations are too numerous. We created 168 single mutations in wild-type Escherichia coli isopropymalate dehydrogenase (IMDH) that match the differences found in wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMDH. 104 mutant enzymes performed similarly to E. coli wild-type IMDH, one was functionally enhanced, and 63 were functionally compromised. The transition from E. coli IMDH, or an ancestral form, to the functional wild-type P. aeruginosa IMDH requires extensive epistasis to ameliorate the combined effects of the deleterious mutations. This result stands in marked contrast with a basic assumption of molecular phylogenetics, that sites in sequences evolve independently of each other. Residues that affect function are scattered haphazardly throughout the IMDH structure. We screened for compensatory mutations at three sites, all of which lie near the active site and all of which are among the least active mutants. No compensatory mutations were found at two sites indicating that a single site may engage in compound epistatic interactions. One complete and three partial compensatory mutations of the third site are remote and lie in a different domain. This demonstrates that epistatic interactions can occur between distant (>20\AA) sites. Phylogenetic analysis shows that incompatible mutations were fixed in different lineages.},

@article{Salverda2011,
abstract = {Whether evolution is erratic due to random historical details, or is repeatedly directed along similar paths by certain constraints, remains unclear. Epistasis (i.e. non-additive interaction between mutations that affect fitness) is a mechanism that can contribute to both scenarios. Epistasis can constrain the type and order of selected mutations, but it can also make adaptive trajectories contingent upon the first random substitution. This effect is particularly strong under sign epistasis, when the sign of the fitness effects of a mutation depends on its genetic background. In the current study, we examine how epistatic interactions between mutations determine alternative evolutionary pathways, using in vitro evolution of the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase. First, we describe the diversity of adaptive pathways among replicate lines during evolution for resistance to a novel antibiotic (cefotaxime). Consistent with the prediction of epistatic constraints, most lines increased resistance by acquiring three mutations in a fixed order. However, a few lines deviated from this pattern. Next, to test whether negative interactions between alternative initial substitutions drive this divergence, alleles containing initial substitutions from the deviating lines were evolved under identical conditions. Indeed, these alternative initial substitutions consistently led to lower adaptive peaks, involving more and other substitutions than those observed in the common pathway. We found that a combination of decreased enzymatic activity and lower folding cooperativity underlies negative sign epistasis in the clash between key mutations in the common and deviating lines (Gly238Ser and Arg164Ser, respectively). Our results demonstrate that epistasis contributes to contingency in protein evolution by amplifying the selective consequences of random mutations.},

abstract = {We have developed maximum likelihood (ML) methods for comparisons of nucleotide sequences from unlinked genomic regions. In the case of a single species, the ML method primarily estimates the effective population size (Ne) under both constant size and abrupt expansion conditions. In the case of two or three species, the ML method simultaneously estimates the species divergence time and the effective size of ancestral populations. This allows us to trace the evolutionary history of the human population over the past several million years (my). Available sequences at human autosomal loci indicate Ne = 10,000 in the Late Pleistocene, a figure concordant with the results obtained from mitochondrial DNA sequence and allele-frequency data analysis, and there is no indication of population expansion. The ML analysis of two species shows that humans diverged from chimpanzees 4.6 my ago and that the human and chimpanzee clade diverged from the gorilla 7.2 my ago. Furthermore, the effective population size of humans more than 4.6 my ago is nearly 10 times larger than Ne of modern humans. The effective population size in the human lineage does not seem to have remained constant over the past several million years. The ML model for three species predicts slightly different, but consistent results to those obtained by the two-species analysis.},

abstract = {Conservation of information (COI) popularized by the no free lunch theorem is a great leveler of search algorithms, showing that on average no search outperforms any other. Yet in practice some searches appear to outperform others. In consequence, some have questioned the significance of COI to the performance of search algorithms. An underlying foundation of COI is Bernoulli's Principle of Insufficient Reason(PrOIR) which imposes of a uniform distribution on a search space in the absence of all prior knowledge about the search target or the search space structure. The assumption is conserved under mapping. If the probability of finding a target in a search space is p, then the problem of finding the target in any subset of the search space is p. More generally, all some-to-many mappings of a uniform search space result in a new search space where the chance of doing better than p is 50-50. Consequently the chance of doing worse is 50-50. This result can be viewed as a confirming property of COI. To properly assess the significance of the COI for search, one must completely identify the precise sources of information that affect search performance. This discussion leads to resolution of the seeming conflict between COI and the observation that some search algorithms perform well on a large class of problems.},

abstract = {The sharpened No-Free-Lunch-theorem (NFL-theorem) states that, regardless of the performance measure, the performance of all optimization algorithms averaged uniformly over any finite set F of functions is equal if and only if F is closed under permutation (c.u.p.). In this paper, we first summarize some consequences of this theorem, which have been proven recently: The number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the total number of possible subsets. In particular, problem classes relevant in practice are not likely to be c.u.p. The average number of evaluations needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimal) solution can be calculated independent of the optimization algorithm in certain scenarios. Second, as the main result, the NFL-theorem is extended. Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL-results to hold are given for arbitrary distributions of target functions. This yields the most general NFL-theorem for optimization presented so far.},

@article{Wolpert1997,
abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of “no free lunch” (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori “head-to-head” minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

@article{Weinberger,
abstract = {'Standard' information theory says nothing about the semantic content of information. Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand consideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has motivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an 'amount of meaning'. This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based on the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood relative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is its usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information as the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's actions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined ensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that satisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from logically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the information 'learned' by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions of the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic in the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic in the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It also follows that the pragmatic information of the genetic 'messages' in an evolving population is a global Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological evolution. A concluding section argues that a theory such as ours must explicitly acknowledge purposeful action, or 'agency', in such diverse fields as evolutionary theory and finance.},

@article{Hitchcock2001,
abstract = {What are the implications if the total 'information' in the universe is conserved? Black holes might be 'logic gates' recomputing the 'lost information' from incoming 'signals' from outside their event horizons into outgoing 'signals' representing evaporative or radiative decay 'products' of the reconfiguration process of the black hole quantum logic 'gate'. Apparent local imbalances in the information flow can be corrected by including the effects of the coupling of the vacuum 'reservoir' of information as part of the total information involved in any evolutionary process. In this way perhaps the 'vacuum' computes the future of the observable universe.},
