<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Architecture is invariably shaped by both its creator and the landscape from which it
emerges. These elements are inextricably intertwined to produce a structure that is
aesthetically pleasing, philosophically erudite, and fully functional. Nowhere is this more
clearly established than with John Ruskin, a noteworthy Victorian art and social critic. His
<span 
class="cmti-12">Seven Lamps of Architecture </span>and <span 
class="cmti-12">The Stones of Venice </span>serve as palimpsests for
contemporary architecture. A link to the past is forged based on foundational
moral, ethical, philosophical, and religious principles that are reflected in the
structures themselves. For Ruskin, when first principles are applied, aesthetic
integrity is maintained, truth and beauty are manifested, and the reflection of God is
contained in the building itself. The architecture may also point beyond itself to
something else, complementing it, expanding it, or transforming it (such as in Gothic
architecture). Applying these Ruskinian laws and virtues to today&#8217;s architecture
provides a framework that grounds the discipline in meaningful theological and
philosophical underpinnings from which inspiration and creativity may emerge.
Contemporary examples include Daniel Libeskind&#8217;s Jewish Museum Berlin that opened in
2001 and Peter Eisenman&#8217;s Holocaust Memorial built in Berlin in 2004. Daniel
Libeskind is also an architect for the One World Trade Center scheduled to be
opened in 2014. The approach taken by these men to design these structures
demonstrates their philosophy that architecture should arise out of history and
landscape. Therefore, the principles of Ruskin function as a palimpsest for the
inspiration, creativity, and designs of architects like Eisenman and Libeskind, as they
seek to recapture and maintain the past through structures that promote their
own interpretation of memory and beauty, and also reflect truth, power, and
life.

<a 
 id="dx1-2001"></a>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >In <span 
class="cmti-12">The Seven Lamps of Architecture </span>(1845), John Ruskin defines architecture as &#8220;the art
which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by man [. . .] that the sight of them may
contribute to his mental health, power, and pleasure&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xruskin1920">Ruskin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xruskin1920">1920</a>, p.&#x00A0;8). He asserts
that good architecture must exhibit seven lamps that represent spirits or laws:
sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory, and obedience. Ruskin sees these as
the framework for architectural creation and design. He believes that good and
beautiful architecture must conform to these laws, and the observer should see that
&#8220;there is room for the marking of his [man&#8217;s] relations with the mightiest, as
well as the fairest, works of God; and that those works themselves have been
permitted, by their [the architects&#8217;] Master and his [man&#8217;s], to receive an added
glory from their association with earnest efforts of human thought&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xruskin1920">Ruskin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xruskin1920">1920</a>,
p.&#x00A0;73). According to Ruskin, architecture that reflects these seven lamps will
draw the builder and the observer toward an experience with the Master Builder,
God.

<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >       Ruskin ties beauty to human beings and their experience with nature in <span 
class="cmti-12">The</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Seven Lamps of Architecture</span>. In one diary entry dated April 19, 1846, Ruskin
describes a day in Champagnole, France and then comments on how nature affected
him:
<a 
 id="dx1-2028"></a>
       I felt it more than usual, but it struck me suddenly how utterly different
       the impression of such a scene would be, if it were in a strange land and
       in one without history. How dear to the feeling is the pine of Switzerland
       compared to that of Canada! I have allowed too little weight to these
       deep sympathies, for I think, if that pine forest had been among the
       Alleghanys, or if the stream had been Niagara, I should only have looked
       at them with intense melancholy and desire for home. (<a 
href="#Xruskin1956">Ruskin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xruskin1956">1956</a>,
       p.&#x00A0;325)
<a 
 id="dx1-2029"></a>
<a 
 id="dx1-2030"></a>
<a 
 id="dx1-2031"></a>
       This observation of creation enables Ruskin to embrace the theory of associationism,
especially its connections to history, which influences his aesthetic appreciation. George
<a 
href="#Xlandow2005">Landow</a>&#x00A0;(<a 
href="#Xlandow2005">1971</a>) points out that Ruskin&#8217;s emphasis on beauty seems to emerge out of these
historical associations that assist his criticism of contemporary architecture. Ruskin finds
the homes and public buildings of his England constructed without style, without regard to
permanence and without meaning for the men who inhabit them. Since he wishes to correct
these deficiencies, he places great emphasis upon historical associations, whose presence,
he says, will insure both that an edifice will influence the life of the inhabitant
and that it will be solidly constructed &#8212; this latter because if a building is to
endure long enough for historical associations to accrue, then it must be well
made.
       Thus, Ruskin&#8217;s establishment of memory as one of his seven laws&#8212;with its focus on
the social, historical, and cultural milieu&#8212;becomes essential to his philosophy of
architecture.

       A  multitude  of  pillars  and  white  domes,  clustered  into  a  long  low
       pyramid of coloured light; a treasure-heap, it seems, partly of gold, and
       partly of opal and mother-of-pearl, hollowed beneath into five great
       vaulted porches, ceiled with fair mosaic, and beset with sculpture of
       alabaster, clear as amber and delicate as ivory &#8212;sculpture fantastic and
       involved, of palm leaves and lilies, and grapes and pomegranates, and
       birds clinging and fluttering among the branches, all twined together
       into an endless network of buds and plumes; and, in the midst of it, the
       solemn form of angels, sceptred, and robed to the feet, and leaning to
       each other across the gates, their figures indistinct among the gleaming
       of the golden ground through the leaves beside them, interrupted and
       dim, like the morning light as it faded back among the branches of
       Eden, when first its gates were angel-guarded long ago. And round the
       walls of the porches there are set pillars of variegated stones, jasper and
       porphyry, and deep-green serpentine spotted with flakes of snow, and
       marbles, that half refuse and half yield to the sunshine, Cleopatra-like,
       &#8220;their bluest veins to kiss&#8221;&#8212;the shadow, as it steals back from them,
       revealing line after line of azure undulation, as a receding tide leaves the
       waved sand; their capitals rich with interwoven tracery, rooted knots of
       herbage, and drifting leaves of acanthus and vine, and mystical signs,
       all beginning and ending in the Cross; and above them, in the broad
       archivolts, a continuous chain of language and of life&#8212;angels, and the
       signs of heaven and the labours of men, each in its appointed season
       upon the earth; and above these another range of glittering pinnacles,
       mixed with white arches edged with scarlet flowers,&#8212;a confusion of
       delight, amidst which the breasts of the Greek horses are seen blazing
       in their breadth of golden strength, and the St. Mark&#8217;s Lion, lifted
       on a blue field covered with stars, until at last, as if in ecstacy, the
       crests of the arches break into a marble foam, and toss themselves
       far into the blue sky in flashes and wreaths of sculptured spray, as
       if the breakers on the Lido shore had been frost-bound before they
       fell, and the sea-nymphs had inlaid them with coral and amethyst.

       These words and drawings reflect the magnificence that resonates in the actual
architecture, authenticating the lamp of beauty, for Ruskin clearly believes that
architecture should reflect the design found in nature and point towards the ultimate
Master Builder.

       With a philosophy based on aesthetics, place, and history, Ruskin appeals to a
moral architecture, encouraging builders to reject the techniques discovered in
the Renaissance and developed in the Industrial Revolution and to embrace a
time when the best buildings were constructed&#8212;the medieval Gothic cathedrals
of England and Venice. In his later book, <span 
class="cmti-12">The Stones of Venice </span>(1851&#8211;1853),
Ruskin describes the elements of the Gothic that became foundational for the kind
of architecture he proposes, and he provides many examples to illustrate. He
points out the three virtues of a building: (1) &#8220;That it act well,&#8221; (2) &#8220;That it
speak well,&#8221; and (3) &#8220;That it look well&#8221; (<a

       The book I called &#8220;The Seven Lamps&#8221; was to show that certain right
       states of temper and moral feeling were the magic powers by which all
       good architecture, without exception, had been produced. &#8220;The Stones
       of Venice&#8221; had, from beginning to end, no other aim than to show that
       the Gothic architecture of Venice had arisen out of, and indicated in
       all its features, a state of pure national faith, and of domestic virtue;
       and  that  its  Renaissance  architecture  had  arisen  out  of,  and  in  all
       its features indicated, a state of concealed national infidelity, and of
       domestic corruption. (<a 
href="#Xruskin1866">Ruskin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xruskin1866">1866</a>, p.&#x00A0;53)
<a 
 id="dx1-3018"></a>
       For Ruskin, moral feeling, states of temperament, and architecture cannot be
separated. He sees the &#8220;moral elements of Gothic&#8221; as follows: (1) savageness, (2)
changefulness, (3) naturalism, (4) grotesqueness, (5) rigidity, and (6) redundance, when
&#8220;belonging to the building,&#8221; and (1) savageness or rudeness, (2) love of change, (3) love of
nature, (4) disturbed imagination, (5) obstinancy, and (6) generosity, when &#8220;belonging to
the builder&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xruskin1885">Ruskin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xruskin1885">1885</a>, p.&#x00A0;155). Thus, Ruskin was not arguing for a new style of
architecture. He was lamenting the plainness and the soullessness of the architecture
designed and built since the Gothic cathedrals of the medieval period. He &#8220;found
certain styles (e.g., Baroque) unacceptable because they exploited illusions, and
therefore were not &#8216;truthful&#8217;&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xcurl2006">Curl</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcurl2006">2006</a>, p.&#x00A0;669). Therefore, according to Ruskin,
in order for architecture to be sincerely honest and truly beautiful, it must be
connected to nature, rooted in right history, and constructed by human hands.

<!--l. 294--><p class="indent" >       The appeal of Ruskin&#8217;s philosophy of architecture was paramount during the
Victorian period. Professor Robert Kerr, a contemporary of the art critic, had previously
espoused the same ideas as Ruskin, but he had left them behind after working twenty years
in the field. He encouraged experienced architects to deter younger apprentices from the
idealistic and romanticized views of Ruskin, for Kerr viewed the architect as &#8220;a servant of
the public for the efficient design of buildings, precisely like the engineer.&#8221; When he
presented a lecture entitled &#8220;Architectural Criticism&#8221; at the Royal Institute of British
Architects, he severely criticized Ruskin saying that &#8220;Mr. Ruskin&#8217;s thoughts soar high
enough in the poetry of visionary art, because poetry is his business, but they cannot
stoop down to the plain prosaic details of the structuresque, because building is
not his business&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xcollins1998">Collins</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcollins1998">1998</a>, pp.&#x00A0;259&#8211;260). In an October 1849 review of
<span 
class="cmti-12">The Seven Lamps of Architecture </span>published in the <span 
class="cmti-12">Journal of Design</span>, Matthew
Digby Wyatt admired &#8220;the excellent spirit&#8221; that was present in &#8220;this thoughtful,
eloquent book.&#8221; However, he quickly points out that Ruskin &#8220;either puts his back
against [. . .] further development, or would attempt to bring back the world
of art to what its course of actions was four centuries ago!&#8221; (<a

<a

</p><!--l. 317--><p class="indent" >       Ruskin does not hesitate to move from art critic to social critic, demonstrating how
the architecture itself can become a commentary on the denigration, deterioration, and
degradation of society. Even as he praises the majesty of St. Mark&#8217;s in <span 
class="cmti-12">The Stones of</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Venice</span>, he also notes the ironic contrast that takes place in its shadows as the masses
ignore its beauty and the poor grovel in their poverty.
       And what effect has this splendor on those who pass beneath it? You
       may walk from sunrise to sunset, to and fro, before the gateway of
       St. Mark&#8217;s, and you will not see an eye lifted to it, nor a countenance
       brightened by it. Priest and layman, soldier and civilian, rich and poor,
       pass by it alike regardlessly. Up to the very recesses of the porches, the
       meanest tradesmen of the city push their counters; nay, the foundations
       of its pillars are themselves the seats&#8212;not &#8220;of them that sell doves&#8221;
       for sacrifice, but of the vendors of toys and caricatures. Round the
       whole square in front of the church there is almost a continuous line of
       cafés, where the idle Venetians of the middle classes lounge, and read
       empty journals; in its centre the Austrian bands play during the time of
       vespers, their martial music jarring with the organ&#x00A0;notes,&#8212;the march
       drowning the miserere, and the sullen crowd thickening round them,&#8212;a
       crowd, which, if it had its will, would stiletto every soldier that pipes
       to it. And in the recesses of the porches, all day long, knots of men of
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
       the lowest classes, unemployed and listless, lie basking in the sun like
       lizards; and unregarded children,&#8212;every heavy glance of their young
       eyes full of desperation and stony depravity, and their throats hoarse
       with cursing,&#8212;gamble, and fight, and snarl, and sleep, hour after hour,
       clashing their bruised centesimi upon the marble ledges of the church
       porch. And the images of Christ and His angels look down upon it
       continually. (<a

href="#Xruskin1885">1885</a>, vol. 2, ch. 4, sec. 15)
       Ruskin observes that society and architecture are invariably connected.
       John Matteson makes this observation concerning Ruskin the social critic: &#8220;The
architecture was sublime; the human activity around it was an obscene mockery. What
good was the building if it could not transform the debauched children who cast
lots on its very steps? After <span 
class="cmti-12">The Stones of Venice</span>, it was no longer enough for
Ruskin to criticize art. It was hierarchies of human beings, not structures of wood
and stone, that begged most loudly for his attention&#8221;(<a

       Since Ruskin&#8217;s time, populations have grown and economic systems
       have  expanded  with  once  unimaginable  speed.  Construction  in  our
       time has to be fast. It must be efficient. It must avoid unnecessary
       expense. If Ruskin foresaw the further mechanization of physical labor,
       he was at least spared the sadness of seeing how far that mechanization
       would  eventually  extend.  Ruskin  also  did  not  anticipate  that  the
       alienation that he saw as poisoning the life of the worker might someday
       encompass  not  only  the  process  of  construction,  but  also  those  of
       conception and design. He could never have imagined on-line catalogs of
       design components or the idea that an architect might one day resolve
       decisions of ornamentation, not with painstaking manual drawing or
       model-building, but with the click of a mouse. Neither could he have
       expected  that  modern  buildings  would  often  be  commissioned  and
       designed, not by individuals at all, but by impersonal organizations.
       It would have been strange, indeed, for Ruskin to discover the myriad
       ways in which architecture could divorce itself from the simple human
       acts of drawing and carving. (<a

href="#Xmatteson2002">2002</a>, p.&#x00A0;300)
<a 
 id="dx1-5005"></a>
       Yet Matteson does not completely reject Ruskin&#8217;s writings about Gothic
architecture, citing the construction of St. John the Divine in Manhattan (Figures <a 
href="#x1-5004r11">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stjohnwide --></a> and
<a 
href="#x1-5006r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:stjohnwestern --></a>) as an exemplar of Ruskinian ideals. In 1972, after no construction had occurred on the
building for thirty years, the dean of St. John the Divine proclaimed that it was time to
once again begin work and that &#8220;the stonework [would] be done by our own unemployed
and underemployed neighbors. We will revive the art of stonecraft&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xmatteson2002">Matteson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmatteson2002">2002</a>,

Ruskinian&#8221;:

       The  spirit  of  the  new  construction  was  profoundly  Ruskinian:  it
       entrusted a sacred Gothic edifice to hands that would begin the project
       raw  and  untutored,  in  expectation  that,  as  the  structure  grew  and
       took shape, so, too, would the skills and souls of the workers. That
       the cathedral actually did become a literal synthesis of stonecutting
       and soul-making, an exemplar of Ruskin&#8217;s demand that the work must
       affirm the passion of the worker, seems to be confirmed in the words of
       Simon Verity, one of the master carvers employed in the project: &#8220;To
       be a carver, you have to have a passion for it, to love it with all your
       heart. It&#8217;s a desire to create order out of chaos, to seek harmonies.&#8221;

href="#Xmatteson2002">2002</a>, pp.&#x00A0;300&#8211;301)
       For Matteson, unskilled human hands touching and carving stone so that
both are built together reflect the perfect aesthetic and moral for the Ruskinian
model, celebrating Ruskin&#8217;s laws of life and truth. He concludes, &#8220;Surely, Ruskin
would have applauded this method of construction, a combination, someone has
said, of outreach and up-reach. And yet his applause might have been tempered
by the knowledge of how deeply the impersonality of technology and profit had
insinuated themselves into the building of the cathedral&#8221; (<a

<!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >       During the Victorian era, Thomas Carlyle (1830), like Ruskin, also demanded
that attention be given to history. In his essay &#8220;On History&#8221; (1830), he says that
meaning in the present and the future can be known only as the past is studied.
He writes: &#8220;For though the whole meaning lies far beyond our ken; yet in that
complex Manuscript covered over with formless inextricably-entangled unknown
characters,&#8212;nay which is a <span 
class="cmti-12">Palimpsest</span>, and had once prophetic writing, still dimly
legible there,&#8212;some letters, some words, may be deciphered&#8221; (author&#8217;s emphasis)
(<a 
href="#Xcarlyle1971">Carlyle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcarlyle1971">1971</a>, p.&#x00A0;56). Uhlig concurs with Carlyle and maintains that in the
intertext, which he likens to the palimpsest (Figures <a 
href="#x1-6001r13">13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:georgianpalimpsest --></a>, <a 
href="#x1-6007r14">14<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:archimedes1 --></a>, and <a 
href="#x1-6009r15">15<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:archimedes2 --></a>), &#8220;historically
conditioned tensions come to the fore: tensions not only between calendar time
and intraliterary time but also between the author&#8217;s intention and the relative
autonomy of a text, or between the old and the new in general&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">Uhlig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">1985</a>, p.&#x00A0;502).
The presence of the past coexists with the text; thus, &#8220;any text will the more
inevitably take on the characteristics of a palimpsest the more openly it allows
the voices of the dead to speak, thus&#8212;in a literary transcription of our cultural
heritage&#8212;bringing about a consciousness of the presentness of the past&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">Uhlig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">1985</a>,
p.&#x00A0;502). Deciphering the present moment of the text as it relates to many past
moments reveals the intertextual meaning the text seeks to convey and the critic to
uncover.

       Architects use the concept of palimpsest to imply a ghost, an image
       of  what  once  was.  Of  course,  in  the  built  environment,  this  occurs
       often,  whenever  spaces  are  shuffled,  rebuilt,  or  remodeled,  shadows
       remain. Tarred rooflines remain on the sides of a building long after the
       neighboring structure has been demolished and long ago removed stairs
       leave a mark where the painted wall surface stopped. Dust lines remain
       from a relocated appliance. Ancient ruins speak volumes of their former
       wholeness. Palimpsests can inform us of the realities of the built past.

       According to Peter Eisenman, an architect and theorist, the palimpsestic
connection of site history with contemporary design and construction is essential: &#8220;Any
site contains not only presences, but the memory of previous presences and the
immanences of a possible presence. The physical difference between a moving thing
(dynamism) and a still one (stasis) is that the moving one contains the trace of
where it has been and where it is going.&#8221; He then connects the history to the city
itself, seeing it as an integral part of the site: &#8220;The introduction of this trace,
or condition of absence, acknowledges the dynamic reality of the living city&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xeisenman2004">Eisenman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xeisenman2004">2004</a>, p.&#x00A0;207). Eisenman describes an architectural palimpsestic text as
follows:

       In my proposal for rhetorical figures, architecture is no longer elements
       but an <span 
class="cmti-12">other </span>grammatical counter, proposing an alternate reading of
       the idea of site and object. &#x00A0;In this sense, a rhetorical figure will be seen
       to be inherently contextual in that the site is treated as a deeply scored
       palimpsest. [. . .] This text suggests that there are other meanings which
       are site specific by virtue of their pre-existence, however latent within
       the context. (<a

       He explains that the word &#8220;text&#8221; when used in relationship to architecture
       can be used for any and all strategies and conditions which dislocate
       architecture from its authorial or natural condition of being; that is,
       the detaching of what architecture looks like from the need to represent
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
       function, shelter, meaning and so forth. It is not so much that the look of
       architecture will change (architecture will always look like architecture)
       but rather the style and significance of its look will be different. The
       idea of text is not in opposition to the reality of architecture, just as
       the imaginary is not the opposite of the real; it is an <span 
class="cmti-12">other </span>discourse.
       Text surrounds reality at the same time that it is internal to reality.

href="#Xeisenman1988">1988</a>)
       Eisenman, like Ruskin, sees that architecture communicates a text beyond its
outward beauty: &#8220;Thus in architecture it is possible to say that text is what always exceeds
the immediate response to a visual or sensory image, i.e. that which we see on the
surface as the story, or that which we see as the beautiful. This is the heart of the
matter&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xeisenman1988">Eisenman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xeisenman1988">1988</a>). Thus, a palimpsest can be defined as that text which
underlies another text (an ur-text)&#8212;a present text with origins in a past one
(palingenesis) or at least shaped by an underlying one (ananke)&#8212;or a text that influences
something not of its own genre&#8212;art, music, architecture (<a

       At first, you retain glimpses of the city. The rows of pillars frame a
       distant view of the Reichstag&#8217;s skeletal glass dome. To the west, you
       can glimpse the canopy of trees in the Tiergarten. Then as you descend
       further, the views begin to disappear. The sound of gravel crunching
       under your feet gets more perceptible; the gray pillars, their towering
       forms tilting unsteadily, become more menacing and oppressive. The
       effect is intentionally disorienting. (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>)
       The construction arises out of the city&#8217;s history, bringing it into the present: &#8220;The
memorial&#8217;s grid, for example, can be read as both an extension of the streets that surround
the site and an unnerving evocation of the rigid discipline and bureaucratic order that
kept the killing machine grinding along. The pillars, meanwhile, are an obvious
reference to tombstones&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>). Yet observation alone is not enough;
one must experience the site &#8220;as a physical space&#8221; in order to truly understand
it:
       No clear line, for example, divides the site from the city around it. The
       pillars along its periphery are roughly the height of park benches. A few
       scattered linden trees sprout between the pillars along the memorial&#8217;s
       western edge; at other points, outlines of pillars are etched onto the
       sidewalk, so that pedestrians can actually step on them as they walk
       by. (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>)
       Sarah Quigley, a novelist and critic, describes her encounter with the memorial:
       Even on bright sunny days, the stones look sober and drab. Standing
       on an uneven piece of land, the stelae almost fall into the centre of the
       site, rising up again towards the edge, forming a myriad of uneven stone
       corridors. Walking down one of these passages is disorientating, and
       scary; you can&#8217;t see who is approaching you, nor who is behind. The
       tilting ground and lack of vision offers some small idea of the Jewish
       experience from WWII: your past snatched away, your future insecure,
       little hope of escape. (<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">Quigley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">2005</a>)
       In this memorial the past haunts both the present and the future.
       Somewhat unexpectedly, Eisenman rediscovered his Jewishness in this architecture:
&#8220;[With this work] I came back to the heart of my identity&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">Quigley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">2005</a>). Even so,
Eisenman is not interested in viewing the Holocaust with sentimentality. He does not &#8220;want
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
people to weep and then walk away with a clear conscience&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>). He wants
all who visit to realize their culpability, to understand &#8220;the process that allows
human beings to accept such evil as part of the normal world - the incremental
decisions that collectively lead to the most murderous acts&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>).
Eisenman &#8220;leaves you standing on the edge of the abyss. In so doing, he suggests that
the parameters of guilt are not so easily defined: it includes those who looked
the other way, continued with their work, refused to bear witness. It is true of
Americans as well as Germans, Roman Catholic clerics as well as Nazi secretaries&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>).
       In contrast to Ruskin who believed that architecture should reflect beauty and point
upward to the ultimate Maker, Eisenman&#8217;s design is plain and its purpose is to cause the
viewer to look inward. Although Paul Spiegel, a leader of the Jews in Germany, felt that
the memorial was &#8220;incomplete&#8221; because it did not shock those who saw it with its history,
Eisenman&#8217;s desire was to promote and elicit a response that concerned more than
just the Holocaust; he wanted people to focus on anti-Semitism in general and
civilization&#8217;s response to it. This discussion would broaden the appeal of the
memorial and make it a part of the daily life of the city (<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">Quigley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">2005</a>). Perhaps this
statement encapsulates Eisenman&#8217;s attitude most of all: &#8220;I think people will eat
their lunch on the pillars. [. . .] I&#8217;m sure skateboarders will use it. People will
dance on top of the pillars. All kinds of unexpected things are going to happen&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">Quigley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">2005</a>). Eisenman&#8217;s prediction has already come true, for Nicolai Ouroussoff
writes, &#8220;The day I visited the site, a 2-year-old boy was playing atop the pillars -
trying to climb from one to the next as his mother calmly gripped his hand&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>).
       The palimpsest of the Holocaust surrounds the site. Nicolai Ouroussoff asserts, &#8220;The
location could not be more apt. During the war, this was the administrative locus of
Hitler&#8217;s killing machine. His chancellery building, designed by Albert Speer and
since demolished, was a few hundred yards away just to the south; his bunker lies
beneath a nearby parking lot&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">Ouroussoff</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xouroussoff2005">2005</a>). Although criticized by some
well-known Germans for its abstract symbolism, its dreary atmosphere, and its
sparse construction (<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">Quigley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xquigley2005">2005</a>) (e.g., no names are etched into the pillars
[<a 
href="#Xbrunberg2012">Brunberg</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbrunberg2012">2009</a>]), Eisenman insists that The Memorial for the Murdered Jews of
Europe &#8220;is both perfect in its symbolism, and a necessary aid to atonement. &#8216;It
stands there, silent,&#8217; he says: &#8216;the one who has to talk is you&#8217;&#8221; (<a

<!--l. 691--><p class="indent" >       Opened in 2001, The Jewish Museum Berlin (Figure <a 
href="#x1-9002r18">18<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:jewishmuseum --></a>) showcases 1700
years of the history of the Jews in Germany. Two buildings house the exhibits,
the old <span 
class="cmti-12">Kollegienhaus</span>, once used as a courthouse, and a new one designed by
Daniel Libeskind. The museum covers 166,840 square feet (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">2011</a>) and
is constructed as a twisted zig-zag to remind museum-goers of a warped Star
of David (<a 
href="#Xmuellerkroll2011">Mueller-Kroll</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmuellerkroll2011">2011</a>). It is entered through an underground tunnel.
A &#8220;Void&#8221;&#8212;a space with nothing in it except 10,000 iron faces that are called
&#8220;Fallen Leaves,&#8221; created by an artist from Israel, Menashe Kadishman&#8212;is part of
the memorial (<a 
href="#Xberlin2012">Installations</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xberlin2012">2012</a>). One visitor describes his experience in this
manner:
       On the floor, thousands of pieces of heavy metal cut into shapes of the
       faces of screaming holocaust victims. The visitor is encouraged to walk
       across the void. Clank, clank, clank echoing up into and all around the
       void. The noise rings in your head but there is no escape because as you
       are tempted to look down the screaming faces stare into your psyche.
       Very simple, very effective. Haunting. (<a 
href="#Xgold2004">Gold</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgold2004">2004</a>)
       The memorial has three intersecting tunnels that are said to represent three
pathways of German life for the Jew: the Axis of Continuity (with German history), the
Axis of Emigration (from Germany), and the Axis of the Holocaust. Then the participant
moves into the Garden of Exile with its 49 pillars that reminds visitors of the people
expelled from Germany, which according to Libeskind, is designed &#8220;to completely
disorient the visitor. It represents a shipwreck of history.&#8221; Even so, Russian willow
oak trees that represent hope have been planted on top of the stelae (<a 
href="#Xberlin2012c">Libeskind
Building</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xberlin2012c">2012</a>).
       Libeskind&#8217;s design entitled &#8220;Between the Lines&#8221; was chosen from a world-wide
competition of 165 entries (<a 
href="#Xlevenson2005">Levenson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlevenson2005">2005</a>), and, of course, the architect was ecstatic when
he won: &#8220;It was a thrilling moment when I was selected. The jury recognized that my plan
was neither dogmatic nor glib; that it served as an individualized mirror, which each visitor
could read in a different way. They valued its authenticity and celebrated its originality. I
felt honored and elated&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2004">Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2004">2004</a>, p.&#x00A0;85).
       Because of his own personal background and experience, Daniel Libeskind knew
that the architecture must first connect the place to its history and then take visitors from
the past to the present and propel them to the future, experiencing a sense of
alienation:
       You  struggle  to  find  the  most  immediate  way  to  get  at  the  truth.
       What was needed, as I saw it, was a building that, using the language
       of architecture, speaking from its stones, could take us all, Jews and
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
       non-Jews alike, to the crossroads of history, and show us that when the
       Jews were exiled from Berlin, at that moment, Berlin was exiled from
       its past, its present, and&#8212;until this tragic relationship is resolved&#8212; its
       future. (<a

       At this museum, Daniel Libeskind believes history and architecture are joined, for
this place &#8220;thematizes and integrates, for the first time in post-war Germany, the
history of the Jews in Germany, the repercussions of the Holocaust and spiritual
displacement. It is also just a museum with exhibits on the wall&#8221; (<a

known as the Gardens of the World (<a

href="#Xny1news2003">NY1

href="#Xny1news2003">2003</a>), Daniel Libeskind was chosen as the architect to create the Ground
Zero Master Plan for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center (Figure <a 
href="#x1-10002r19">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:groundzeroplan --></a>)
(<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">2011</a>). As he put together the design, he realized, &#8220;We have to be
able to enter this hallowed, sacred ground while creating a quiet, meditative and
spiritual space&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>). He was very sensitive to the site and
to New Yorkers, desiring for his plan to fully memorialize what had happened
there:
       When  I  first  began  this  project,  New  Yorkers  were  divided  as  to
       whether to keep the site of the World Trade Center empty or to fill
       the site completely and build upon it. I meditated many days on this
       seemingly impossible dichotomy. To acknowledge the terrible deaths
       which occurred on this site, while looking to the future with hope,
       seemed like two moments which could not be joined. I sought to find
       a solution which would bring these seemingly contradictory viewpoints
       into an unexpected unity. So, I went to look at the site, to stand within
       it, to see people walking around it, to feel its power and to listen to its
       voices. (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>)
       For Libeskind, this project was personal: &#8220;What happened on 9/11 was not
something abstract, it happened to me&#8221; (qtd. in Earle). In fact, on the day Libenskind
opened his Jewish Museum in Berlin, the Twin Towers in New York were attacked and
then collapsed. As soon as he received word around 2:30 p.m., he left for the
States. He still remembers that day, &#8220;I turned to all my colleagues [. . .] and I do
not know where it came from, but I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m returning to Lower Manhattan&#8217;&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">Needham</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">2011</a>).
       Because of disagreements among all those involved, the project was eventually
removed from Libenskind (<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">Needham</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">2011</a>). Even though many architectural changes were
made, the WTC Masterplan (Figure <a 
href="#x1-10002r19">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:groundzeroplan --></a>) as delineated by Libeskind was still basically
followed:
       The  WTC  Masterplan  serves  as  both  the  conceptual  basis  and
       the  technical  foundation  for  the  entire  complex  re-development  of
       ground  zero.  The  Masterplan  defines  the  spirit  of  the  approach  to
       re-building  and  creates  a  meaningful  conceptual  framework  for  the
       site.  It  also  defines  the  spatial  organization  of  all  elements  of  the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
       development within the site with an emphasis on the human experience
       and  the  public  realm.  The  Masterplan  dictates  the  location  and
       massing of each program element, building height and relative size,
       as  well  as  proximity  and  relationship  to  one  another.  The  WTC
       Masterplan also supplies the framework for the site&#8217;s infrastructure,
       transportation, sustainability standards and security strategy and lays
       out  the  functional  relationship  between  all  the  site  elements  with
       respect to the surrounding context of the immediate neighbourhoods
       and the surrounding city. (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2011">2011</a>)
       Michael Arad, the final designer, credits Libeskind as the one who &#8220;&#8216;established the
broad parameters&#8217; of what is now the new World Trade Center and &#8216;acted as a guidestar. If
you&#8217;re going to build something, you need to start some place.&#8217;&#8221; Libeskind acknowledges
his part in the process: &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy to be able to design a piece of this city.&#8221; He observes,
&#8220;If you&#8217;re a conductor or a composer, Stravinsky or Copland, and the New York
Philharmonic is performing your piece and you&#8217;re conducting it, do you regret that you&#8217;re
not playing the first violin? That you&#8217;re not playing the tuba? Of course not&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">Needham</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhuffpost2012">2011</a>). Therefore, he asserts confidently, &#8220;In the end, the public will see the
symbolism of the site. [. . .] Of course, compromises had to be made, but a master
plan is not about a few lines drawn on paper. It&#8217;s about an idea, and how to
express that idea through the turmoil of politics and the creativity of all the other
architects. In the end, the result will be pretty close to my original rendering&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xdavidson2007">Davidson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdavidson2007">2007</a>).
<a 
 id="dx1-10003"></a>
       Libenskind&#8217;s original plan reflects his intense interest in symbolism. He
wanted the foundations of the former buildings to be part of the memorial site
(&#8220;We need to journey down, some 70 feet into Ground Zero, onto the bedrock
foundation, a procession with deliberation into the deep indelible footprints of
Tower One and Tower Two&#8221;), and he emphasized their connection to the nation
itself.
       The great slurry walls are the most dramatic elements which survived
       the attack, an engineering wonder constructed on bedrock foundations
       and  designed  to  hold  back  the  Hudson  River.  The  foundations
       withstood  the  unimaginable  trauma  of  the  destruction  and  stand
       as  eloquent  as  the  Constitution  itself  asserting  the  durability  of
       Democracy and the value of individual life. (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>)
       Libeskind imagined &#8220;the sky&#8221; as &#8220;home again&#8221; to &#8220;vertical gardens&#8221; on &#8220;a towering
spire of 1776 feet high&#8221; (symbolic of the founding of the country, the year when the
Declaration of Independence was signed)&#8212;the &#8220;Gardens of the World,&#8221; filled with plants
from all parts of the earth (<a

explains, &#8220;Why gardens? Because gardens are a constant affirmation of life. A skyscraper
rises above its predecessors, reasserting the pre-eminence of freedom and beauty, restoring
the spiritual peak to the city, creating an icon that speaks of our vitality in the face of
danger and our optimism in the aftermath of tragedy&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>).
<a 
 id="dx1-10004"></a>
<a 
 id="dx1-10005"></a>
       Reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty, the tower would be off-center in its northwest
corner, designed to pay homage to the Statue of Liberty&#8217;s torch which Libeskind
remembers seeing when he was 13 years old in 1959 when he came to the United States
from Poland (<a 
href="#Xswanson2011">Swanson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xswanson2011">2011</a>). Indeed Libeskind&#8217;s ideas emerge out of his experience as an
immigrant. He explains in his proposal for the reconstruction of Ground Zero: &#8220;I arrived by
ship to New York as a teenager, an immigrant, and like millions of others before me, my
first sight was the Statue of Liberty and the amazing skyline of Manhattan. I have never
forgotten that sight or what it stands for. This is what this project is all about&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio
Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>).
<a 
 id="dx1-10006"></a>
<a 
 id="dx1-10007"></a>
       The Wedge of Light piazza and the Park of Heroes open spaces were significant
places in Daniel Libeskind&#8217;s plan (<a 
href="#Xmanhattan2003">Lower Manhattan Development Corporation</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmanhattan2003">2003</a>).
Libeskind explains how his design remembers the ones who died: &#8220;Those who were lost
have become heroes. To commemorate those lost lives, I created two large public
places, the Park of Heroes and the Wedge of Light. Each year on September 11th
between the hours of 8:46 a.m., when the first airplane hit and 10:28 a.m., when the
second tower collapsed, the sun will shine without shadow, in perpetual tribute to
altruism and courage&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">Studio Libeskind</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlibeskind2012">2012</a>). Once again, the symbolism is
paramount.

       The construction of the lynchpin building finally started in 2006 and is scheduled to
be finished in 2014. The One World Trade Center, or the 1 WTC, previously called the
Freedom Tower (Figure <a 
href="#x1-10008r20">20<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:oneworld --></a>), will occupy the place where the original 6 World Trade Center
stood. When completed, the 1 WTC will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere
rising 1,776 feet as originally envisioned by Libeskind (<a 
href="#Xhabitat2012">Council on Tall Buildings
and Urban Habitat</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhabitat2012">2012</a>). Like Ruskin and Eisenman, Libeskind&#8217;s design is
inextricably linked to history. As Michael Earle observes, &#8220;In terms of design, his
best buildings are connected strongly to history and are deeply influenced by
it.&#8221; His masterplan is &#8220;a palimpsest of the site itself&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xearle2012">Earle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xearle2012">2012</a>). The past
coexists with the architectural texts, and thus reaffirms that &#8220;any text will the more
inevitably take on the characteristics of a palimpsest the more openly it allows the
voices of the dead to speak, thus [. . .] bringing about a consciousness of the
presentness of the past&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">Uhlig</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xuhlig1985">1985</a>, p.&#x00A0;502). Earle acknowledges the changes
made to the masterplan but affirms its influence: &#8220;While some other parts of the
masterplan have been eliminated or changed in political wrangling, the design
remains true to itself. As I write this, we are 4 days from the 10th anniversary of
September 11th 2001 and the plan that Libeskind created has enough remaining
power to make the place where so many people perished, a historical site whose
architecture proudly defends its memories&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xearle2012">Earle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xearle2012">2012</a>). As demonstrated through his
symbolism, the design has been connected to memory, one of the seven laws of
architecture delineated by Ruskin, as he affirms that architecture must respect the
social, historical, and cultural character of its surroundings. Earle concludes, &#8220;The
design stands as a true description of palimpsest. As this important anniversary
comes and goes, we can appreciate the work of great architecture and design
which helps to commemorate that awful moment when the world changed forever&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xearle2012">Earle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xearle2012">2012</a>). The One World Trade Center stands&#8212;arising from the palimpsest of
September 11, 2001&#8212;and reflects both the tragedy and the triumph of the site.

       In architecture, site and design are inseparably linked to produce a structure that
focuses on the lamps of truth, power, beauty, life, and memory, as delineated by John
Ruskin. These ideals have in some profound ways become the palimpsest for contemporary
architects, such as Peter Eisenman and Daniel Libeskind, demonstrating that &#8220;any site
contains not only presences, but the memory of previous presences and the immanences of
a possible presence&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xeisenman2004">Eisenman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xeisenman2004">2004</a>, p.&#x00A0;207). In these structures built to commemorate
the Holocaust and the tragedy of 9-11, history haunts the visitors&#8212;the past informs
the present that prepares the participants for the future. They experience the
horrible events that happened there and are forced to embrace what lies ahead.
