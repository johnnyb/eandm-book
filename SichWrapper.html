positively skeptical&#8212;if not openly hostile to&#8212;metaphysical thought. Metaphysics is
unfortunately not understood as the classical systematic study of being as being and the
properties that apply to all beings, but a grab-bag of diverse problems (e.g., free will, the
existence of God, mind-body, &#8220;eviscerated&#8221; causality, etc.), whose only common bond is
that they cannot be solved by the natural sciences, phenomenology, or other
hyper-specialized disciplines.

dime-bookstores. An examination of the conference itself will provide a backdrop for this

</p><!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >
       In short, metaphysics <span 
class="cmti-12">is </span>about the ultimate nature of reality. It includes
       many aspects of reality that are generally skipped over in standard
       physics,  such  as  choice,  creativity,  morality,  aesthetics,  etc.  While
       many engineers implicitly use their understanding of metaphysics when
       developing solutions, our goal is to move that thinking into explicit
       terms, so that those parts of our understanding can be better explored
       and systematized. Science is often bound by a methodological disregard
       for anything other than efficient causes. However, as engineers, our job
       is to include the whole of reality, and provide solutions that incorporate
       our  entire  knowledge  of  reality.  Therefore,  this  conference  aims  at
       starting the discussion of how the fields of metaphysics and engineering
       influence each other (<a

  class="enumerate" id="x1-1018x1">Indeed,  metaphysics  is  &#8220;about&#8221;  the  ultimate  nature  of  reality,  but  in  a
      qualified sense. Practitioners study the principles of all contingent existents
      (beings) and, hence, can support reflection upon &#8220;choice, creativity, morality,
      aesthetics&#8221;&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;and revealed knowledge. For example, in biology extra-mental
      objects known as <span 
class="cmti-12">living things </span>are studied; within the philosophy of nature this
      biological knowledge of living things is reflected on to understand what <span 
class="cmti-12">life </span>is; in
      metaphysics what <span 
class="cmti-12">beingness </span>is&#8212;what it means for a thing to exist&#8212;is studied,
      irrespective of whether the object considered is living or not, or whether the
      object is an extra-mental existent or a being of reason, etc.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1020x2">This means there is no place for the study of choice (free will) in physics because
      physics has an altogether different subject matter: extra-mental material objects
      undergoing physical changes. Free will is not an object of study in the same
      sense that a neutrino is. If a physicist were to suggest the only types of existents
      are material objects and physical phenomena, or if he were to suggest free will
      can be &#8220;located&#8221; behind quantum indeterminacy, or if he were to argue that
      something can indeed come from nothing, that physicist would not be &#8220;doing&#8221;
      physics but philosophy, and bad philosophy at that.<sup><a

      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1022x3">Moreover,
      metaphysical categories and &#8220;thinking&#8221; cannot be &#8220;move[d]&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;into explicit
      terms, so that those parts of our understanding can be better explored and
      systematized.&#8221; The methodologies and language employed by metaphysics are
      not those of engineering. The latter operates almost exclusively in univocal
      terms; the former also employs analogous terms, primarily because &#8220;being&#8221; is
      itself an analogous notion. The demand that metaphysics be reduced to &#8220;explicit
      terms&#8221; is a surreptitious reduction of the kinds of beings studied in metaphysics
      down to the ontological level of those beings studied by engineering.

knowing and loving God: &#8220;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy

the role of truth in all human activities, i.e., the distinction of seeing man as a

from (3) the thinking done to make things (i.e., productive of artifacts). In the

objects studied. The question &#8220;what <span

distinction. For example, is a &#8220;neutrino&#8221; the same <span

not focus on the essence (&#8220;whatness&#8221;) or nature of the object, and it doesn&#8217;t
need to, nor can it. Once that basic level of motion is understood, one can then
incorporate into the question other factors that will influence the motion: initial
angular momentum, air resistance, expansion due to rapid heating, curvature of the
earth, air currents, manufacturing flaws, etc. In fact, given time, patience, and

Fourier analysis, complex functions, etc.) must ultimately be reducible to discrete
and continuous quantities abstracted from real objects. Mathematics is therefore
the study of things that can be imagined and conceived without matter, not
just the abstraction from the particular for the philosophy of nature and the
individual natural sciences. The focus of mathematics is upon the first Aristotelian
category of real being&#8212;quantity, again whether continuous (surfaces, volumes,
etc.) or discrete (integers, countables, etc.) or relational (equations, inequalities,
etc.).

</p><!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >       Quantity, as the first accident of real being, is the basis for quality&#8212;the second
accident of real being. For example, the average temperature of air in a room presupposes a
non-point-like <span 
class="cmti-12">res extensa</span>&#8212;a thing spatially extended&#8212;and the ability to measure
(quantify). Furthermore, quality admits of degree; quantity does not. For example, no
number (quantity) of kindergarteners adds up to the intelligence (quality) of
Einstein.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-12" id="enmark-12"><span 
class="cmr-8">12</span></a></sup> Finally, geometry, for example, is not concerned with the question of
whether a triangle (as imagined from some extra-mental object) is made of copper
or of wood, but only with its absolute quantifiable nature, according to which
it has three sides and three angles that add to 180 degrees in Euclidean (flat)
space.

</p><!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >       The final level of abstraction is actually <span 
class="cmti-12">separation</span>: all material aspects
are left behind or separated from that which can exist without matter. Angels,
for example, are purely immaterial beings and as such cannot in any way be
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
imagined, for imagination requires an image&#8212;a picture&#8212;in the mind. Metaphysical
terms such as unity, substance, soul, potency, causes, etc. exist without matter as
well because such concepts apply to all extra-mental existents. In metaphysics,
therefore, one does not study being as changeable (philosophy of nature) or as
quantifiable (mathematics) but being as being, and hence such being can only
be resolved through concepts in the mind. As such, metaphysics is the study of
the foundational principles of all beings&#8212;those aspects shared by <span 
class="cmti-12">all </span>contingent
beings.

<a

</p><!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >       In a strong sense, metaphysics is really at the heart of philosophy since it deals with
the nature of reality in its widest throw. Metaphysics comprises two main areas or
sub-disciplines: ontology and transcendental metaphysics. Ontology concerns itself with
responding to the question &#8220;what exists?&#8221; while Transcendental Metaphysics concerns itself
with the questions &#8220;what is it for something to exist?,&#8221; &#8220;are there different modes of
existence?,&#8221; and &#8220;if there are different modes of existence, what are the truth makers for
these modes?&#8221;
</p><!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >       More specifically, <span 
class="cmti-12">ontology </span>attempts to formulate a complete list of the fundamental
categories of being, while <span 
class="cmti-12">transcendental metaphysics </span>concerns itself with (a) a
fundamental understanding of essence, existence, nature, cause, etc., and the
relationships between them, (b) the truth makers for modal claims, and (c) the
transcendental attributes of being&#8212;attributes which apply to all beings simply as
beings.
</p><!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >       An example of this philosophical approach is shoes. What is common or universal to
all shoes cannot be drawn or imagined. As such, there is absolutely nothing which
can be sensed&#8212;and hence measured&#8212;about &#8220;shoeness.&#8221; When one has an idea
(not image!) of what is common to all shoes, of every shape, size, color, style,
etc., one has grasped <span

(individual) sciences&#8212;including the productive sciences such as medicine and engineering
and architecture&#8212;depend upon metaphysics for their ultimate presuppositions and basic
principles. The particular sciences seek to understand their particular subject
matters through the proximate &#8220;ultimate&#8221; causes within their particular domain.
And, no science can prove its own proximately considered first principles. There
must be one foundational science (metaphysics) which seeks to understand all
reality&#8212;all contingent beings&#8212;in terms of the universal properties of being as
such.

</p><!--l. 228--><p class="indent" >       For example, <span 
class="cmti-12">change</span>, and the species of change called &#8220;local motion&#8221; (translational,
vibrational/oscillatory, and rotational/circular) can be illustrated through the following
scenario. Suppose a group of one hundred people, chosen at random, were asked if they
were seismologists that have modeled tectonic subduction zones. The expected response
would be one, perhaps two. If the same group was asked if they had experienced an
earthquake, the response might increase to about fifteen people. If they were asked if
they know <span 
class="cmti-12">what </span>motion is, or at least if they had experienced it, the hands of all
the people in the group would be raised. This example highlights the difference
between the narrowly, yet deeply focused work of scientists, those who have had
special experiences and hence knowledge, and the common knowledge shared by all
individuals.
<a 
 id="dx1-4006"></a>
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >       Motion (change of position of a material object as a function of time) for a physicist
is relatively easy compared to the general notion of what motion is. Physics only asks &#8220;how
do things change/move?&#8221; whereas the philosopher must ask &#8220;<span 
class="cmbxti-10x-x-120">what </span><span 
class="cmti-12">is </span>change in its widest
throw?&#8221; Motion for the philosopher is merely a species of change, for it is not merely a
metaphor to assert, &#8220;I was <span 
class="cmti-12">moved </span>by the beauty of my wife.&#8221; There was a &#8220;before&#8221; when I
was not moved, and then there was an &#8220;after&#8221; when my potential to be moved was
actualized into reality&#8212;the reality of actually being in love. Hence, the most
general definition (i.e., not the narrow physics-based definition) of motion is &#8220;the
reduction from potency to act, insofar as the object is in potency.&#8221;<sup><a 
href="#ennote-13" id="enmark-13"><span 
class="cmr-8">13</span></a></sup> It is this
general definition&#8212;based upon common experience accessible to all&#8212;that provides
the foundation for physicists to do their good, mathematically described work.
Change had to be understood in its widest, most general throw before physics
could narrow that understanding of change to study material objects in physical
motion.
</p><!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >       So, the three speculative sciences can be defined as follows:

      a circle, the statistical distribution of students&#8217; test scores is described by a
      normal curve, etc.

therefore by them know (a) which actions conform to reality, (b) what ought to be done,
and (c) how and why one should act.

</p><!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >       In fact, the study of the applied sciences can only be successful to the extent the
pure sciences are incorporated. Ethics or moral philosophy answers the questions, &#8220;what
should humans do&#8221; and &#8220;why?&#8221; The arts (including engineering as productive of
ARTifacts) are subordinate to ethics. Engineers must first decide what ought to be done
(which implies knowing why). Then and only then may they enter into the details of how to
do it. For example, knowing how to abort a child cannot trump knowing whether or not
one should do so. Through science and technology, weapons of mass destruction in Iran
can be detected through remote sensing. But no natural scientific, technological,
or engineering discipline can then determine what should be done about those
weapons.

object&#8217;s form (formal cause or specificity) and <span 
class="cmti-12">telos </span>(final cause or function) by providing
the example of pincers. Neither mathematics nor the natural sciences can explain what the
tweezers in my hand, the pliers in my tool box, the bigger pliers in my plumber&#8217;s
tool box, the pincers of a lobster&#8217;s claw, the forceps of a surgeon, the mandibles
of a bull ant, the jaw of a human being, or a fireman&#8217;s &#8220;jaws of life&#8221; are. Yet,
any intelligent agent can explain that all these examples are understood by the
<span 
class="cmti-12">universal (i.e., not concrete and hence immaterial) concept </span>of a compound lever.

the pressure applied at the point of contact, the position of the fulcrum, etc.

correctly concludes: &#8220;The only thing all pincers have in common is an intended
purpose, design, or function&#8212;in short, a form. While quantifiable shapes can be the

theological implications,<sup><a

the existence of a material object&#8212;the neutrino&#8212;from physical observables, i.e., from the
apparent violation of conservation of energy and angular momentum in beta decay
processes. Intelligent Design theorists attempt to infer the existence of &#8220;design&#8221;
and hence a designer. But this, of course, begs the question: Is design the same
ontological kind of thing as a neutrino? No, for unless one is a materialist or
other such reductionist (which is a hidden irony of Intelligent Design), design is a
very different kind of thing than a neutrino. This, in turn, then demands a very

science.

or final cause, which is neither a subject matter (formal object) nor material
object studied by any of the modern empirical sciences. To repeat Machuga&#8217;s point
above, even if one considers a pair of pliers, a nut cracker, an insect&#8217;s mandibles,
and a lobster claw, as having one and the same <span

measure&#8212;literally to quantify by means of a metric&#8212;the differences in function
between the physical examples above? Again, one cannot mathematically distinguish
functions. The function is the same for all the examples above (and many more),
while their mathematically describable complexities (through the correlation of
sensory-accessible properties into mathematical formalisms) vary widely. Complexity
and information are quantifiable, while functionality and essence (meaning) are
not.

       One would have to be out of one&#8217;s mind to deny design in the universe. But, the
reductionist view of &#8220;design&#8221; proffered by Intelligent Design proponents and &#8220;design&#8221; as
understood by critically thinking philosophers are two different things. Reason alone and
independently (as well as faith alone) can lead us to knowledge of the &#8220;existence&#8221; of Pure
Existence Itself (&#8220;I AM THAT I AM,&#8221; Exodus 3:14, KJV), i.e., to knowledge of the
&#8220;existence&#8221; of the Creator. But, for the former the path is <span 
class="cmti-12">through </span>metaphysical reflection
<span 
class="cmti-12">starting from </span>the natural sciences (or engineering or general observations). The former
establishes a &#8220;that&#8221; for &#8220;existence&#8221; (the so-called god of the philosophers), while the latter
establishes the relational &#8220;who&#8221; and is the basis for the trust known as &#8220;faith&#8221; in <span 
class="cmti-12">the</span>
God.
       No amount of empirical data can defeat a metaphysical proof or principle. Clearly,
empirical data, scientific theories, and engineering expertise <span 
class="cmti-12">inform </span>metaphysical reasoning.
But such reasoning is impervious to empirical falsification&#8212;similar to a mathematical
theorem not being falsifiable by any empirical data. For example, no new empirical data
will ever alter the fact that in the context of Euclidean (flat) geometry, the sum of all
interior angles of any triangle adds to 180 degrees. Moreover, no new empirical data will
ever defeat the Principle of Non-Contradiction, poor philosophizing on the part of certain
quantum physicists notwithstanding.

<a

<a

       No empirical data or scientific theories exist in a vacuum: there is no &#8220;preferred&#8221;
metaphysical interpretation attached. Yet, there must be interpretations. Whether
implicitly or explicitly, secularist scientists embrace the notions of &#8220;philosophical&#8221;
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
naturalism and materialism as animated by scientism. To counter this, the Intelligent
Design movement cannot hope to misappropriate science, or especially to find a
&#8220;new home,&#8221; in engineering. It must adopt a realist philosophy of nature. That
is where the real battle for the mind is fought&#8212;not in or through the natural
sciences. What this implies, of course, is that Intelligent Design proponents must
face some deep soul-searching to realize Intelligent Design does not belong in the
biology classroom any more than DarwinISM does. That is the only way the
Intelligent Design movement will reclaim the high ground, and only then will it be
unstoppable.
<a 
 id="dx1-6038"></a>
       The failure to distinguish the proper roles and subject matters studied in the
natural sciences, metaphysics, and engineering will only lead to confusion&#8212;of which
Intelligent Design and DarwinISM are only two unfortunate examples.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-25" id="enmark-25"><span

these disciplines are respected and their differences celebrated (a tuba would sound ugly
usurping the part of a piccolo), i.e., if they are permitted to operate as a symphony
productive of truth&#8212;with the particular science as the individual instruments, metaphysics
as the conductor, and God as the composer&#8212;the music would, indeed, be Divinely
beautiful.

class="cmr-10">flows from the use of </span><span
