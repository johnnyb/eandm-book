       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> Philosophy and Pragmatism, Science and Engineering</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >When engineering comes to mind, people usually think about bridges and computers, math
and science&#8212;in other words, a practical application of technology to life. Seldom
do they connect engineering with philosophers and theologians. However, the
truth is that these ultimate things are thoroughly embedded within engineering,
even if they are rarely reflected upon. The act of construction relies on certain
assumptions about the nature and limitations of the world as well as the nature and
limitations of the builders. The <span 
class="cmti-12">purpose </span>of a building or software program is just as
important to its structure as its materials or design. These considerations are
closer to philosophy or theology than they are to math and science. However, the
reasoning involved in such considerations is hardly ever formalized or even made
explicit.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >       On the flip side of the coin, engineering is often used as the ultimate test of
knowledge. In America, at least, a thing is not really considered true or authentic or of
value unless someone can use it to build a better product, e.g., a better phone. This
concept reflects the philosophical heritage of William James, the father of the pragmatic
school of philosophy. In pragmatism, the ultimate test of ideas is their &#8220;cash
value&#8221;&#8212;what people can <span 
class="cmti-12">do </span>with the ideas. For pragmatists, the search for <span 
class="cmti-12">truth</span>
for its own sake is somewhat misguided because truth cannot be apprehended
until it is applied to real-world problems. For better or worse, this tends to be
the philosophical framework by which most modern people live. Therefore, the
ultimate test of knowledge is whether or not we can build something out of it.
This pragmatic philosophy makes <span 
class="cmti-12">testability</span>, the cash value of scientific ideas, so
fundamental to the practice of science. It evaluates one or more scientific models
based on their <span 
class="cmti-12">practical </span>consequences. This is why quantum mechanics (which
is testable) holds a much firmer place in science than string theory (which is
not).
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >       Such an emphasis on practicality has caused modern humanity to all but abandon
speculative pursuits such as philosophy. Some recent scientists, most notably Stephen
Hawking and to a lesser extent Lawrence Krauss, have openly rejected philosophy
(<a 
href="#Xwarman2011">Warman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwarman2011">2011</a>;&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xandersen2012">Andersen</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xandersen2012">2012</a>). However, such an attitude disregards the great
contributions that such speculative endeavors have had on even the most practical
concerns. Modern science, in fact, is based on the rigorous and unremitting application of
ideas which originated in philosophy. The conservation laws in physics are really nothing
except a practical expression of the philosophical idea of <span 
class="cmti-12">ex nihilo nihil fit </span>(out of nothing,
nothing comes), also called the &#8220;principle of sufficient reason,&#8221; which dates back to before
Aristotle (<a 
href="#Xpsr2011">Melamed &amp; Lin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpsr2011">2011</a>).
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >       Pragmatism itself is an outgrowth of philosophy. Although pragmatism often
represents itself as being outside of speculative philosophy, its very nature arises out of
speculative reasoning. Pragmatism is the outgrowth of Liebniz&#8217;s concept of &#8220;the identity of
indiscernibles,&#8221; which was first put forth in his <span 
class="cmti-12">Discourse on Metaphysics </span>(<a 
href="#Xident2012">Forrest</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xident2012">2012</a>).
The identity of indiscernibles states that if two things are distinct from each other,
there will be some property or group of properties which will also be distinct.
Pragmatism is merely the act of looking for properties that make two theories
distinct from each other, or makes reality identical or distinct from some theory. If
a theory is identical with reality, then the properties which hold in the theory
should also hold in reality. Testing is merely probing reality to determine, on the
basis of the identity of indiscernibles, whether or not the theory is identical with
reality.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >       So, as it turns out, science, testability, and the fundamentals of physics all draw
directly from speculative philosophy. Rather than science or pragmatism getting rid of
the need for speculative philosophy, they prove its importance. What modern
scientific thought has actually demonstrated is that sound philosophy, over time,
generates rock-solid principles, principles that are so solid that most practicing
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
scientists simply assume their truth as self-evident, often unaware that these ideas
have had a history within philosophy and are the result of centuries of reflection,
debate, and development. It is true that not everything in philosophy is as sound
or solid as these principles. However, to reject philosophy just because newer
ideas have not achieved the status as the more well-developed ones is simply to
reject the general advance of knowledge because philosophers have not achieved
certainty yet. Rather than dismissal, what is needed is more active engagement and
development.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >       Not only do many modern scientists reject philosophy, but the manner in which
these higher ideals are treated by the mainstream culture demonstrates the belief that
everything not directly rooted in pragmatism is a mere matter of opinion. Thus, in
discussions about society and social governance, any attempt to include reasonings based
on the nature, purpose, and ideals of humanity, tend to be met with ramblings about how
ideas such as these are private, personal matters, and not suitable for public inquiry and
discourse. Rejecting such philosophical reasoning in public discourse and deeming such
knowledge as a matter of personal preference is as irrational as saying, &#8220;The principle of
sufficient reason doesn&#8217;t apply to me.&#8221; It may be true that people don&#8217;t know or agree on
the ideals of humanity, however, this should not be taken as an excuse to reject them as
targets of public discussion, but rather a reason to explore them further and
deeper.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> Reintegrating Philosophy into Science and Engineering</h3>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >As has been previously demonstrated, science&#8217;s great progress has been the result of the
continual and unrelenting application of sound philosophy, such as the principle of sufficient
reason and the identity of indiscernibles, into all areas of inquiry. It seems reasonable, then,
that additional progress can be made by explicitly recognizing the link between these fields
and encouraging more cross-disciplinary dialog. While some progress in this has been made,
more is desperately needed.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >       In 2000, Baylor University held a conference called <span 
class="cmti-12">The Nature of Nature</span>. Its goal
was to bring scientists, philosophers, and other academic disciplines together to talk about
the ultimate nature of reality. Specifically, the question was whether <span 
class="cmti-12">naturalism</span>, the idea
that all of reality is a self-contained physical system, was a valid presupposition in the
pursuit of science (<a 
href="#Xgordondembski2011">Gordon &amp; Dembski</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xgordondembski2011">2011a</a>). If naturalism is true, then any
phenomena must be, at least in theory, describable by references to physics. Therefore,
any idea not reducible to physics should not be considered a valid explanation.
In such a view, for instance, <span 
class="cmti-12">design </span>might be a description, but it cannot be a
cause. A soul might be a useful fiction, but it cannot be a reality. Free choice is an
illusion.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >       The <span 
class="cmti-12">Nature of Nature </span>conference included the very people who built many modern
scientific fields, including Francis Crick (who discovered DNA and the genetic code), Roger
Penrose (whose contributions to physics are similar to Stephen Hawking&#8217;s), Guillermo
Gonzalez (who pioneered work on galactic habitability zones), and many other experts and
professionals in science and philosophy. While the conference did not come to any
particular conclusion, it was successful in moving the question concerning the ultimate
nature of reality from the periphery to a more central position. Alvin Plantinga&#8217;s
contribution to the conference, for instance, eventually culminated in his book, <span 
class="cmti-12">Where the</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism</span>, published by Oxford University
Press (<a 
href="#Xplantinga2011">Plantinga</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xplantinga2011">2011b</a>,<a 
href="#Xplantinga2011b">a</a>).
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >       The conference eventually resulted in a book named after the conference, <span 
class="cmti-12">The</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">Nature of Nature </span>(<a 
href="#Xnatnat2011">Gordon &amp; Dembski</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xnatnat2011">2011b</a>). One thing, however, was markedly absent
from the list of topics&#8212;any discussion of the practical consequences of any of the theories
of reality offered by the conference attendees. In other words, many interesting ideas
were put forth, but nothing concrete enough to result in the building of a better
phone.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >       Since the <span 
class="cmti-12">Nature of Nature </span>conference, at least two conferences which dealt with the
relationship between the nature of nature, science, and engineering have been held. The
first was the Royal Academy of Engineering&#8217;s <span 
class="cmti-12">Engineering and Metaphysics </span>seminar in
2007. The focus of this conference was the relationship between ontology (philosophy of
being) and process engineering (the act of doing). In addition, a conference in 2009
titled <span 
class="cmti-12">Parallels and Convergences </span>at Claremont Graduate University tackled a
variety of questions focused around the large-scale goals of engineering&#8212;including
space exploration and transhumanism&#8212;and their integration with the purposes of
humanity.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >       In 2011, a conference was planned to address two major areas of integration between
engineering, philosophy, and theology. The first was to examine how philosophical and
theological ideas can be directly integrated into the practice of engineering. The
second was to investigate how the tools of engineering can be retrofitted to analyze
philosophical and theological questions. This resulted in the 2012 Conference on
Engineering and Metaphysics, whose proceedings is contained in this present
volume.

<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >The papers in this volume, for the most part, follow the talks given in the Engineering and
Metaphysics 2012 Conference.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-1" id="enmark-1"><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></a></sup> Between the participants, presenters, and authors, there
exists some overlap between this conference and the original <span 
class="cmti-12">Nature of Nature </span>conference
which inspired it. The authors come from a variety of backgrounds&#8212;academically,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
spiritually, and socially. Since the participants included philosophers, theologians,
engineers, computer scientists, and liberal arts professors&#8212;a truly interdisciplinary
group&#8212;the book has been subtitled &#8220;an interdisciplinary investigation of order and design
in nature and craft.&#8221;
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >       The conference was indeed focused on investigation, an intense desire to look deeper,
to search in a number of different directions as evidenced in the Table of Contents.
Nature was investigated from an engineering perspective, and engineering from
various perspectives on nature. Even the investigation was investigated. At the
conclusion of the conference, what was produced were not finished masterpieces
but new ways of holding the brush and painting the canvas, analyzing problems
in engineering, philosophy, and theology through new lenses. Some ideas and
approaches surely will be more successful in the long run than others, but each
one benefits the discussion by looking at old questions in new and unfamiliar
ways.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >       Some questions asked include the following: Can theological questions be
asked mathematically? Can nature be rigorously analyzed in terms of purpose as
well as by matter in motion? Can the human spirit be integrated into science?
Can it be used to analyze engineering outputs? Does it leave a distinctive mark
on nature? How does theology change the goals and processes of engineering?
Which of these questions are ill-posed and unworkable, and which have lasting
value?
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >       These questions are all foundational questions. This volume is not designed to be a
finishing point for these types of investigations, but rather to serve as an inspiration to
others to ask even better questions along the same lines. The hope is that entirely new
fields will emerge at the boundaries of theology, philosophy, science, and engineering,
which will ask new questions, develop new methodologies, and learn not only new
answers, but also entire new ways of understanding. In short, the goal for the
conference and this volume is not a final answer, but an initial inspiration. After
perusing these proceedings, the reader will be challenged to reexamine the borders
and boundaries of disciplines, and to think about the world in new and exciting
ways.

reverse engineering is a fruitful methodology for natural investigations. It suggests that
