Putting together a volume like this requires a significant amount of hard work from a large number of people.  This book began as a conference, and we would like to begin by thanking Oral Roberts University for hosting the original 2012 Conference on Engineering and Metaphysics which serves as the foundation for this volume.  Next we would like to thank those who provided assistance in producing the book---
Heather Zeiger for providing additional copyediting, 
Robert Lamar, for providing design assistance,
Goran MarasoviÄ‡, for the cover design,
and Eric Holloway and Winston Ewert for providing additional help with typesetting.  We would like to especially thank all of the authors in this volume for following us down an untrodden road to blaze new trails, and we would like to thank our readers for the same.
