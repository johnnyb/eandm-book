<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >A worldview consists of what one believes to be true about the universe and all of reality,
including &#8220;how things work.&#8221;<sup><a 
href="#ennote-1" id="enmark-1"><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></a></sup> Worldviews are formed by mentally processing and filing
away the accumulated experiences of life. Inaccurate worldviews can prove hazardous to
one&#8217;s health. Although young children do not know the inverse square law of
gravitation from physics, they learn very quickly to respect the influence of gravity, or
suffer the painful consequences. Other aspects of reality take somewhat longer
to ascertain. But from the first moments of life, human beings enter this world
as little private investigators, gathering clues as to how the world works. They
are truth-seekers, especially when it comes to that which brings satisfaction and
enjoyment. Upon discovery of a new object, they immediately embark on a crude
type of reverse engineering exercise to determine what can be known about this
object and what uses it might afford. Toddlers often go through a phase where
they enjoy banging a spoon against pots and pans. Perhaps this affords them an
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
early experience of understanding that they possess the power to control their
environment, to some small degree. Or maybe they just like to make the banging sound.
In either case, it results in increased hand-eye coordination and knowledge of
causation.





</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >       As children get older and become more adept at reverse engineering techniques,
they often pass through a phase characterized by repeated dissections of both
natural and man-made objects. Perhaps taking apart complex organisms/devices
facilitates the discovery of hidden connectivities, or internal affordances, which
sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of operation. Or maybe they just like
to see if spiders can still walk around with fewer than their original number of
legs.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-2" id="enmark-2"><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></a></sup> In either case, this type of behavior is often seen as a precursor to a career
in science or engineering.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-3" id="enmark-3"><span 
class="cmr-8">3</span></a></sup> This innate and seemingly insatiable curiosity is a
very interesting feature of all human beings, especially when coupled with the
extraordinary comprehensibility of the world<sup><a 
href="#ennote-4" id="enmark-4"><span 
class="cmr-8">4</span></a></sup>, since it results in many profitable
and satisfying affordances. Both humans and the external world appear to be
engineered so that interactions with the environment result in vital knowledge, which
plays a key role in gaining wisdom and maturity for a full and abundant life.










</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >       This paper is an investigation into the usefulness of state-of-the-art reverse
engineering concepts and techniques for accurate worldview formation, with particular
interest in how the field of natural theology may be influenced by thinking of nature in
terms of affordances. An affordance is simply what an object provides to an &#8220;end user.&#8221; In
the case where the object is a more complex multi-component system, affordances are also
recognized to exist internally, between interacting parts of the system. Hence, an affordance
is also what one part of a system provides to another part of the system. Traditionally,
reverse engineering has focused on identifying functionality, but recent engineering
design research (<a 
href="#Xmaier2008">Maier</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmaier2008">2008</a>, pp. 34&#8211;37)<sup><a 
href="#ennote-5" id="enmark-5"><span 
class="cmr-8">5</span></a></sup> suggests that affordance-based reverse
engineering may be more appropriate for handling the complexity associated with many
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
natural systems. It may also be more helpful in design recovery, a subset of reverse
engineering that attempts to work out what a system was designed to do, how it
does it, and why it works the way it does. Design recovery goes beyond simply
examining a system&#8217;s component parts and their interactions and attempts to
identify both purpose and logical organization. Although not expected to lead to
definitive results in the case of natural systems, this approach contributes to a better
understanding of why the universe is the way it is<sup><a 
href="#ennote-6" id="enmark-6"><span 
class="cmr-8">6</span></a></sup>, resulting in positive contributions to
the field of Christian apologetics, and consistent with a new vision for natural
theology.<sup><a

<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >Reverse engineering is the process by which anything that has been made is analyzed to
determine the original design information that went into its development.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-8" id="enmark-8"><span 
class="cmr-8">8</span></a></sup> Though not a
major branch of engineering curriculum in academia, reverse engineering has been studied
and implemented extensively in many industries where it often assists in gaining a
competitive advantage. In this sense it is considered to be a mature field in practice, if not
in theory. Engineering programs at some universities are now recognizing the value of
reverse engineering activities as a design training exercise for students (<a 
href="#Xwu2008">Wu</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwu2008">2008</a>, pp.
57&#8211;59). They disassemble and analyze power tools and other man-made devices in
order to see how design principles and practices guide engineers in developing a
well-made product. Reverse engineering concepts are also used extensively in
deciphering unfamiliar or poorly documented computer software and hardware systems
(<a 
href="#Xeilam2005">Eilam</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xeilam2005">2005</a>).







</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >       But recently reverse engineering techniques have proven to be surprisingly fruitful
when applied to natural systems. Although the field of systems biology<sup><a 
href="#ennote-9" id="enmark-9"><span 
class="cmr-8">9</span></a></sup> has expanded
rapidly in the past few years, there is a long history behind this approach. One of the
earliest scientists/engineers to record detailed reverse engineering studies of biological
systems, including extensive dissections of the human body, was Leonardo da Vinci.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Concerning this work, he wrote that &#8220;the human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a
work of art.&#8221; Evidently, his intimate knowledge of biological systems led him to a deep
appreciation for the beautiful functionality they exhibit. In the 1600s, William
Harvey discovered the detailed flow patterns of blood within the human body by
asking himself how an engineer would have constructed such a system (<a 
href="#Xauffraynoble2009">Auffray &amp;
Noble</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xauffraynoble2009">2009</a>).



</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >       In more recent times, scientists like E. O. Wilson and Daniel Dennett concur with
the necessity of the reverse engineering approach. Wilson writes that &#8220;the surest way to
grasp complexity in the brain, as in any other biological system, is to think of it as
an engineering problem&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xwilson1998">Wilson</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xwilson1998">1998</a>, p.&#x00A0;112). Dennett claims that &#8220;you just
can&#8217;t do biology without doing reverse engineering, and you can&#8217;t do reverse
engineering without asking what reasons there are for whatever it is you are studying.
You have to ask &#8216;why&#8217; questions&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xdennett1996">Dennett</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdennett1996">1996</a>, p.&#x00A0;213). Though Dennett may
disagree with the idea of ultimate purpose, these are questions of a teleological
nature, and other scientists and engineers are coming to the same conclusion. For
example, Caltech researchers ask &#8220;What is/are the purpose(s) of this biological
system?&#8221;<sup><a 
href="#ennote-10" id="enmark-10"><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></a></sup> and suggest that biological systems be approached from an &#8220;engineer&#8217;s
perspective.&#8221; Arthur Lander at UC Irvine has proposed a system for thinking in these
terms and writes that &#8220;these elements can be seen as the foundations for a new
calculus of purpose, enabling biologists to take on the much-neglected teleological
side of molecular biology. &#8216;What purpose does all this complexity serve?&#8217; may
soon go from a question few biologists dare to pose, to one on everyone&#8217;s lips&#8221;
(<a 
href="#Xlander2004">Lander</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlander2004">2004</a>).



</p><!--l. 264--><p class="indent" >       If such teleological, yet scientific questions are being asked at the micro-scale, then
it seems reasonable that such questions could also be posed at the macro-scale.
Furthermore, since such profitable answers are being found by reverse engineering at the
level of the cell, it makes sense that good answers might also be found on a larger scale
using this approach. The idea that qualitative questions can be answered through
quantitative approaches is affirmed by Lander in another article where he summarizes the
lessons learned from systems biology. He concludes the article with, &#8220;They teach a lesson
about biology that is as important as it is surprising: sometimes, answering the most
qualitative of questions &#8211; &#8216;Why does the organism do it that way?&#8217; &#8211; succeeds only
through the most quantitative of approaches&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xlander2007">Lander</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xlander2007">2007</a>). These insights from
systems biology suggest that reverse engineering of natural systems may not only
reveal the inner workings of the cell, but may also assist in the acquisition of
a more complete understanding of mankind&#8217;s origin, place and purpose in the

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> Interpreting Natural Systems</h3>
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >Even before the time of Christ, Greek and Roman philosophers practiced a kind of reverse
engineering of natural systems, interpreting the beneficial order in the universe as an
indication of a larger plan or design of a Mind (<a 
href="#Xsedley2009">Sedley</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xsedley2009">2009</a>). Socrates and Plato believed
that in addition to providing the initial order to the universe, this Mind also acted to
sustain it at all times. About 50 years before Christ, Marcus Cicero, who brought Greek
philosophy to the Romans, even suggested that various characteristics of the
creating deities could be inferred from the highly ordered work of their hands. He
interpreted harmonious movements in nature by referring to similarities with
man-made objects when he wrote, &#8220;When we see some example of a mechanism,
such as a globe or clock or some such device, do we doubt that it is the creation
of some conscious intelligence? So when we see the movement of the heavenly
bodies&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;how can we doubt that these too are not only the works of reason but of a
reason which is perfect and divine?&#8221; (Cicero, <span 
class="cmti-12">De Natura Deorum</span>, 2.38.97, trans.
1972)






</p><!--l. 311--><p class="indent" >       Paul the Apostle wrote in a similar vein to the Romans when he penned the well
known verse, &#8220;For since the creation of the world God&#8217;s invisible qualities&#8212;his eternal
power and divine nature&#8212;have been clearly seen, <span 
class="cmti-12">being understood from what has been</span>
<span 
class="cmti-12">made</span>, so that men are without excuse&#8221; (Romans 1:20 NIV, emphasis added). Paul, being a
highly educated Hebrew from Tarsus, would have been well aware of the prevailing
philosophies of his audience. His words seem to mesh nicely with the idea of reverse
engineering, which is about gleaning design information regarding an object, and if
possible, also uncovering what may be known about the original engineer and his/her
intentions. This is largely accomplished through a systematically obtained understanding of
the object in the context of its surrounding culture and environment. In this
verse, Paul may be referring to human understanding derived from observations of
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
specific objects in nature, or the entire cosmos, or both.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-11" id="enmark-11"><span 
class="cmr-8">11</span></a></sup> It is suggested that
modern reverse engineering techniques would find profitable application in both
cases.





</p><!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >       Nineteenth century natural theologians such as William Whewell and William
Buckland practiced an early form of reverse engineering of natural systems, focusing on the
implications for a Christian worldview. For Whewell, there was one Biblical teaching that
stood out as a heuristic for science: that human beings are created in the image and
likeness of God (<a 
href="#Xfuller2006">Fuller</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xfuller2006">2006</a>, p.&#x00A0;283). This similarity between creator and creature, like
the match between the complexity of the universe and mankind&#8217;s ability to comprehend it,
should facilitate the process of reverse engineering. Recognizing that one could never fully
comprehend the transcendent engineering of the creator, nonetheless, for a Christian, there
is a sense that science is the gift and privilege of &#8220;thinking God&#8217;s thoughts after
him.&#8221;<sup><a

href="#Xroberts1999">1999</a>, p.&#x00A0;245). Leading
anatomists of the time regarded this animal as having a poor and bungled design. But
Buckland chose it to show, by &#8220;careful and rigorous anatomical description and then the
application of reverse engineering,&#8221; that it was &#8220;perfectly designed or adapted for its
environment.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;Here, for Buckland, design was not so much a scientific theory, but
rather a metaphysical or theological outlook, which gave confidence or grounds for applying
reverse engineering procedures&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xroberts1999">Roberts</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xroberts1999">1999</a>, p.&#x00A0;248). It makes sense for a Christian
engineer or scientist to apply such procedures in laboring under the hypothesis that the
universe is an engineered system<sup><a 
href="#ennote-13" id="enmark-13"><span 
class="cmr-8">13</span></a></sup>, without any preconceived notions about how such
transcendent engineering was accomplished. This is consistent with the thinking of leading
theologians of today, like Alister McGrath, who suggests that natural theology is to be
understood as &#8220;the enterprise of seeing nature as creation, which both presupposes
and reinforces fundamental Christian theological affirmations&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmcgrath2006">McGrath</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmcgrath2006">2006</a>,
p.&#x00A0;64).



</p><!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >       McGrath also asserts that &#8220;the order of things determines how things are
known&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;or, to put it more&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;formally: ontology is to be allowed to determine

href="#Xmcgrath2006">McGrath</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmcgrath2006">2006</a>, pp. xv&#8211;xvi). Again, this is consistent with a reverse
engineering mindset, which approaches the task with a certain humility, recognizing
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
that what is discovered will in large part determine how to proceed with the
overall investigation. In exploring the metaphor of nature as book, philosopher
Angus Menuge writes that &#8220;a good scientific interpretation is one that allows
nature to speak for itself and yet which is motivated by and connected to an
overarching frame of meaning provided by revealed theology&#8221; (<a

       directed    to    certain    (limited)    achievements.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;This    logical
       organization according to function can be explained on its own terms &#8211;
       as an objective aspect of a naturalistic <span 
class="cmti-12">science</span>; interpretation in terms
       of divine agency is not essential. By such a naturalistic study of creation
       in its own contingent terms of reference, we would only discern the
       embodied logic of creaturely things themselves, not their transcendent
       divine purpose or design.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;Theologically, such a situation invites
       the idea that God&#8217;s work of creation, like his work of redemption, may
       be seen as the expression of a self-giving, self-emptying love: that is,
       creation seen as kenosis. While this view poses some difficult questions,
       it deserves serious consideration. (<a

       But even with the attempt to keep science and theology separate, it seems likely
that such theological musings will also influence aspects of an ongoing scientific approach.
For those pursuing advances in both science and theology, the two fields are often found to
be quite compatible, leading to many fruitful interactions.

href="#Xdennett1990">1990</a>, p.&#x00A0;177). He further asserts that optimality
considerations should be used, rather than attempting to analyze the intentions of
a designer. As an example, he cites the Antikythera device, a complex geared
mechanism discovered in an ancient shipwreck in 1900. Dennett contends that &#8220;it
was&#8212;almost certainly&#8212;an orrery or planetarium, and the proof of that is that it
would be a good orrery. That is, calculations of the periods of rotation of its
wheels led to an interpretation that would have made it an accurate (Ptolemaic)
representation of what was then known about the motion of the planets&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xdennett1990">Dennett</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdennett1990">1990</a>,
p.&#x00A0;180). Dennett is correct, as far as the function of the device, but many other
interesting questions might be addressed through a more complete approach to reverse
engineering.

device in a fascinating book (<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">Marchant</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">2009</a>). A significant amount of design
recovery was accomplished in terms of the purpose of the device and the identity
and thinking of the original engineer(s). Referring to Greek letters engraved on
the casing of the device, she writes, &#8220;[The reverse engineer] also noted that the
letters were so precise they must have been engraved not by a labourer but by a
highly trained craftsman&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">Marchant</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">2009</a>, p.&#x00A0;55). She also recognized that
the incorporation of historical and cultural information from the time period
was valuable for unlocking some of the mysteries of the device. As an example,
consider the following passage: &#8220;Archaeologists also studied the rest of the salvaged
cargo. Their discoveries help to paint a vivid picture of when the ship sailed,
where her load was being taken, and the sort of world from which she came. From
there we can guess at the origins of the Antikythera mechanism itself, and how it
ended up on its final journey&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">Marchant</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmarchant2009">2009</a>, p.&#x00A0;61). Thus, it is clear that
reverse engineering is most effective when all pertinent information is brought to
bear. This is accomplished by looking at the &#8220;big picture&#8221; instead of limiting the
study to the narrow set of data obtained by simply dissecting the specimen.<sup><a

</p><!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >       Dennett&#8217;s approach to reverse engineering through optimality considerations has
recently been criticized from a couple directions. Philosopher Robert Richardson contends
that such an approach to evolutionary psychology lacks the standard level of evidential

gets more to the heart of the matter, looks specifically at Dennett&#8217;s insistence on
optimality as the guiding beacon of the reverse engineering enterprise. Philosophers
Krist Vaesen and Melissa van Amerongen have recently published an extensive
analysis of Dennett&#8217;s artifact hermeneutics. They argue that &#8220;Dennett&#8217;s account is
implausible&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;[and] conclude that, quite in contrast to Dennett, intentional
considerations play a crucial role in artifact hermeneutics, and even stronger, are
necessary for the sake of simplicity and precision&#8221; (<a

</p><!--l. 532--><p class="indent" >       Vaesen and van Amerongen claim that artifacts should be interpreted by relying

approach might still be achieved leads to an interesting final paragraph. They
write,
       Of course, it still might be possible to establish a generic interpretive

       to  argue  for  the  importance  of  intent  in  the  interpretation  of
       organ(ism)s, is a proof that intent reveals things that remain hidden
       under an optimality account or that it is beneficial to ignore optimality
       and dig for a designer&#8217;s &#8211; i.e., nature&#8217;s &#8211; intentions instead. It is far
       from evident that such things can be done without entering the waters
       of creationism. Fortunately, the burden of proof is on, if any, those
       who think our understanding of biofunctions is &#8211; or should be &#8211; linked
       to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8217;s&#8221; intentionality. (<a

       Vaesen and van Amerongen&#8217;s demand for a <span

remain hidden under an optimality account is quite a stringent requirement. In the
remainder of this article it should become clear that, although short of a proof, there is a
significant amount of evidence that this is the case. Considerations of intention while
conducting affordance-based reverse engineering of natural systems do reveal
valuable things that remain hidden and unrealized under Dennett&#8217;s approach.

complete documentation.&#8221; Each of these steps is explained in very helpful detail in Rekoff&#8217;s

</p><!--l. 619--><p class="indent" >       Another helpful article, although dealing mainly with the reverse engineering of
computer software, introduces the concept of &#8220;design recovery.&#8221; &#8220;Reverse Engineering and
Design Recovery: A Taxonomy&#8221; by Elliot Chikofsky and James Cross defines design
recovery as &#8220;a subset of reverse engineering in which domain knowledge, external
information, and deduction or fuzzy reasoning are added to the observations of the subject
system to identify meaningful higher level abstractions beyond those obtained
directly by examining the system itself.&#8221;(<a 
href="#Xchikofskycross1990">Chikofsky &amp; Cross II</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xchikofskycross1990">1990</a>, p.&#x00A0;15)
In other words, the goal of design recovery is to work out, at a higher level of
understanding, what a system or component was engineered to do, and (to some
degree of confidence) why, rather than just examining its subcomponents and
their interrelationships. This generally involves extracting design artifacts by
detecting design patterns, for example, and synthesizing abstractions that are
less dependent on implementation. The authors believe that it is these higher
level abstractions that are the key to fully reverse engineering complex natural
systems. In another article, Ted Biggerstaff further expounds on the idea, &#8220;Design
recovery recreates design abstractions from a combination of code [system], existing
design documentation (if available), personal experience, and general knowledge
about problem and application domains.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;Design recovery must reproduce all
of the information required for a person to fully understand what a program
[system] does, how it does it, why it does it, and so forth.&#8221;(<a

<!--l. 732--><p class="noindent" >In a recent article in <span 
class="cmti-12">Mechanical Engineering</span>, Jonathan Maier calls for a rethinking of
design theory by emphasizing that design problems begin at the system level. He claims
that &#8220;individual components can be designed only after the whole problem has been
understood and defined at the system level and then decomposed into subsystems
and so forth, down to individual components that can be designed using the
hard engineering sciences and traditional analysis methods&#8221; (<a

<a 
href="#Xmaier2011">Maier</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmaier2011">2011</a>). Major engineering projects have become so complex and far-reaching that
George Hazelrigg has argued that design is no longer just multidisciplinary; it is
<span 
class="cmti-12">omni-disciplinary </span>in that any and all disciplines may be involved in the solution
to a particular design problem (<a 
href="#Xhazelrigg1996">Hazelrigg</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhazelrigg1996">1996</a>). Maier is convinced that the
complexities of systems thinking and user interactions require design engineers to
move beyond the level of simply designing for component or product function.
The concept that he proposes is <span 
class="cmti-12">affordance</span>, which is what a system provides
to a user or to another system. An (positive) affordance is what something is
&#8220;good for&#8221; or &#8220;good at&#8221; and may serve as an underlying and unifying principle in
the science of design (<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2001">Maier &amp; Fadel</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2001">2001</a>). It is important to note that the
affordances of a system depend on the physical form of the system, whereas the
functions of a system do not. This is a useful feature &#8220;because it allows engineers
to analyze and compare the affordances of product concepts (especially at the
system level) as well as of existing products for reverse engineering&#8221; (<a

p.&#x00A0;36).



</p><!--l. 761--><p class="indent" >       Although the term &#8220;affordance&#8221; has its roots in Gestalt psychology (<a

perceptual psychologist James Gibson defined it in the modern era as &#8220;what it [the

and the environment&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xgibson1979">Gibson</a>,&#x00A0;<a

class="cmti-12">Everyday Things </span>(<a 
href="#Xnorman1988">Norman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xnorman1988">1988</a>), steers the concept toward engineering design, but stops
short of Maier&#8217;s contention that it is fundamental to the design or reverse engineering of
any artifact. However, Norman does admit that &#8220;affordances provide strong clues
to the operations of things&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xnorman1988">Norman</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xnorman1988">1988</a>, p.&#x00A0;9). Maier emphasizes that the
affordance-based approach to design captures important interactions within the
engineer-artifact-user triad that the function-based approach misses. In reverse engineering
applications, a fourth role must be added to the triad&#8212;that of the investigator or
reverse engineer. Interesting interactions may be elucidated among these four roles
by incorporating the concept of affordances. Maier compares the strengths and
weaknesses of function-based and affordance-based design and comes to an interesting
conclusion; there are several &#8220;appealing synergies&#8221; or &#8220;ways in which strengths of
function complement weaknesses of affordance, and ways in which the strengths
of affordance complement the weaknesses of function&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2002">Maier &amp; Fadel</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2002">2002</a>).
These synergies include a better view of &#8220;the big picture,&#8221; a uniting of design
methods, and a theoretical underpinning of design that illuminates the proper role of
function.




</p><!--l. 793--><p class="indent" >       In further work by Jonathan Maier and Georges Fadel on affordance-based
methods for design and reverse engineering, they describe two kinds of affordances.
Artifact-user-affordances (AUA) are defined as &#8220;the set of interactions between artifact and
user in which properties of the artifact are or may be perceived by the user as potential
uses. The artifact is then said to <span 
class="cmti-12">afford </span>those uses to the user. Artifact-artifact-affordances
(AAA) can be defined as the set of interactions between two artifacts in which some
properties of one artifact interact in some useful way with properties of the other
artifact&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2003">Maier &amp; Fadel</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmaierfadel2003">2003</a>). In addition, they explain how both types of
individual affordances can be considered as positive or negative depending on
whether the interaction is good for the system or not. Furthermore, each affordance
can have a quality of interaction associated with it depending on how well the
interaction serves its role. For example, a chair may afford sitting much better than a
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
large rock, and the weight of a large rock may be seen as a negative affordance if
portability is an issue. Maier and Fadel claim that a systematic evaluation of the
affordances of each part of a system can be combined into a comprehensive affordance
structure matrix (ASM), including both AUA and AAA (Maier, Ezhilan, and
Fadel, <a 
href="#Xmaieretal2003">2003</a>; Maier, Sandel, &amp; Fadel, <a 
href="#Xmaieretal2008">2008</a>). The system is then effectively reverse
engineered in the sense that its operation is well understood. The ASM lists system
components on a horizontal axis and affordances along a vertical axis. The matrix is
populated by identifying which components are associated with each affordance.

<!--l. 828--><p class="noindent" >In March of 2002, the cover story for <span

Biological Complexity&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xcsetedoyle2002">Csete &amp; Doyle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcsetedoyle2002">2002</a>), which encouraged the application of
engineering concepts like those borrowed from control theory to better understand the
complex workings of biological systems. The article also emphasized the modularity and
protocols that were being discovered within such systems at the time. Protocols were
described as &#8220;rules that prescribe allowed interfaces between modules, permitting system
functions that could not be achieved by isolated modules&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xcsetedoyle2002">Csete &amp; Doyle</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xcsetedoyle2002">2002</a>, p.&#x00A0;1666).
Thus, understanding interacting modules and the protocols that specify those interactions
is critical to identifying the affordances between modules (AAA). An interesting analogy
was drawn between biological structures and the modules and protocols of the Lego toy
system, demonstrating in multiple ways how biological systems exhibit features that are
readily associated with engineered devices. The article concludes by encouraging biologists
and engineers to &#8220;compare notes.&#8221; Since this paper was published, it seems that many have
been doing just that.

this leads to successful experimentation, he writes, &#8220;But it seems clear, at least
to a physiologist, that productive research is catalyzed by assuming that most
biological systems are devices. Thinking today of your biological preparation as
a device tells you what experiments to do tomorrow.&#8221; Many of these types of
experiments serve to identify affordances. At Stanford University, an aerospace
engineer, Claire Tomlin, and a molecular biologist, Jeffrey Axelrod, teamed up to
extol recent efforts aimed at &#8220;understanding biology by reverse engineering the
control&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xtomlinaxelrod2005">Tomlin &amp; Axelrod</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xtomlinaxelrod2005">2005</a>, pp. 4219&#8211;4220). They summarize an extensive
reverse engineering study of the mechanism used by bacterium E. coli to combat
heat shock (El-Samad, Kurata, Doyle, Gross, &amp; Khammash, <a 
href="#Xelsamadetal2005">2005</a>), claiming that
it &#8220;is just what a well-trained control engineer would design, given the signals

href="#Xtomlinaxelrod2005">Tomlin &amp; Axelrod</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xtomlinaxelrod2005">2005</a>, 4219). Viewing the heat
shock response as a control engineer would, the researchers developed a reduced
order mathematical model to analyze the dynamics of each of the interacting
modules. This analysis then motivated a series of simulation experiments on a
larger mathematical model. The experiments involved disconnecting one or more
information pathways (both feedback and feedforward protocols) which allowed
comparison of various closed-loop and open-loop responses. As a result, they obtained
a clearer picture of how certain information pathways and protocols afforded
robustness, efficiency, and noise attenuation. Tomlin and Axelrod claim that this
analysis

       system,  but  because  it  decomposes  the  mechanism  into  intuitively

<!--l. 902--><p class="noindent" >In order to illustrate the application of this approach to even more complex natural
systems, consider the further example of a human being. Is it possible, or even reasonable,
to apply reverse engineering and design recovery techniques in an effort to gain insight into
this system?<sup><a 
href="#ennote-19" id="enmark-19"><span 
class="cmr-8">19</span></a></sup> Of course, this approach assumes the possibility of a designer whose
products lend themselves to such techniques. Multiple popular worldviews adhere to the
existence of a master engineer/architect of some kind, and the point was made earlier that
complex natural systems are currently being successfully reverse engineered. Thus, this
seems like an interesting and fruitful pursuit. This approach is especially fitting
under the further assumption that humans are &#8220;made in the image&#8221; of such a
master engineer, which is characteristic of a Christian worldview. This would
presumably help to explain why there is such a profitable match between the
complexity of the cosmos and the mental capabilities of humans. Such a match forms
the basis for any successful reverse engineering of natural systems. However, the
Christian worldview also entails the existence of an adversary who opposes the
work of the master engineer, which may make the reverse engineering task more
challenging.

</p><!--l. 930--><p class="indent" >       The first step is to define the roles of artifact, user, investigator, and engineer that
make up the big picture of design and reverse engineering. For this case the artifact can be
considered as the human being, although it is difficult to separate humans from their finely
tuned cosmic environment. The end user is the human mind, or consciousness, in the sense
that human minds make use of their bodies in living their lives. In a Christian worldview,
there is also a sense in which God is the end user, since he has made all things for himself.
The investigator, or reverse engineer, is anyone who is curious enough to pursue this kind
of study. It is important to recognize this so that the investigator can limit the bias
that affects his or her analysis. Admittedly, there is some overlap among these
roles, but that should not negate the potential fruitfulness of this analysis. As for
the engineer, whether it is the tinkerer of naturalism, or God, or space aliens, it
is hoped that more can be discovered about this engineer&#8217;s motives, methods
and intentions (or lack thereof) by properly applying the reverse engineering
process.

</p><!--l. 949--><p class="indent" >       Just listing all the affordances that the universe (artifact) exhibits towards
the human consciousness (user) would be a complex and time-consuming task,
but by looking at those that are the most significant, insights can begin to be
gleaned. To start off, the cosmos affords humans with the ability to learn. By
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
studying the universe and its interactions, such as those between stellar bodies,
molecules, or light, humans are able to gain knowledge about why previous natural
events occurred the way they did and predict how future events might follow the
same pattern. The human mind is able to experience these because of the sensory
organs, which the human body, as an artifact in the universe, affords to the human
mind.

</p><!--l. 962--><p class="indent" >       This brings up an interesting question; what else does the human body afford the
consciousness? According to Oxford philosopher Richard Swinburne (<a

placed, and yet still be a humanly free intelligence, the mind needs the human body to

       Not all initial conditions (ICs) or laws of nature would lead to, or
       even permit, the existence of human bodies at some place or other,
       and at some time or other, in the universe. So we may say that the
       universe is &#8216;tuned&#8217; for the evolution of human bodies if the laws and
       initial conditions allow this to occur. If only a very narrow range of
       laws and ICs allow such evolution, then we may say that the universe
       is &#8216;fine-tuned&#8217; for this evolution. Recent scientific work has shown that
       the universe is fine-tuned. (<a 
href="#Xswinburne2004">Swinburne</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xswinburne2004">2004</a>, p.&#x00A0;172)
       Now, the existence of the human body, due to these fine-tuned conditions is an
important aspect of human consciousness because of the affordances mentioned above.
What is even more amazing is that the fine-tuning of the universe not only allows for life
but allows for persons who are able to question why the universe is the way it is. The
fine-tuning of the universe then also affords the human consciousness with the ability to
discover attributes of the engineer by questioning and observing how something so
encompassing as the cosmos can be so elegant and well-engineered. With this in mind, the
investigator can then appreciate the overlap with the area of the user as the human
consciousness.





       Considering that the user and investigator are roles filled by the same person brings
a new dynamic and even more complex affordances between the different components of the
system. As the investigator, the human consciousness begins to question why things
are the way they are within the system, and if there is any way to improve the
system. Humans have been attempting this from the beginning of conscious thought
with innovations and inventions meant to increase the quality of life. Recently,
what scientists have discovered is that many of these new inventions have already
existed in nature. A prime example of this is the boat propeller and the bacterial
flagellum.





       The ability of humans to not only perceive affordances but also imagine how they
might be creatively achieved is discussed in an article entitled &#8220;Affordances are Signs&#8221;<sup><a 
href="#ennote-22" id="enmark-22"><span 
class="cmr-8">22</span></a></sup> by
psychologist John Pickering (<a 
href="#Xpickering2007">Pickering</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpickering2007">2007</a>). He asserts,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
       The characteristic reflexivity of human cognition means that we are
       not only able to perceive the world as it is, that is, to perceive the
       affordances that actually surround us, but also to perceive affordances
       that  do  not  yet  exist,  that  is,  to  perceive  the  world  as  if  it  were
       otherwise.  When  we  take  a  rock  and  modify  it  with  blows  until  it
       functions as a blade, we do just that. We not only perceive what is,
       but also what may be and hence we may take meaningful, intentional
       action to bring it about if we so choose. (<a 
href="#Xpickering2007">Pickering</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xpickering2007">2007</a>, p.&#x00A0;73)








       The interesting thing that Swinburne points out is that the choices humans make
not only tend to affect the world and others around them but also to affect their own
characters (recursion), giving them some measure of influence over the kinds of people they
eventually become. This is a very interesting affordance, which when coupled with
the human ability to envision a preferable future, leads people to form various
purposes related to self-organization (autopoiesis) and self-improvement. However, a
common experience among humans is the inability to realize accepted standards and
expectations. In an article entitled &#8220;The Kingdom of God and the Epistemology of
Systems Theory: The Spirituality of Cybernetics&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xbuker2009">Buker</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xbuker2009">2009</a>), William Buker, a
Professor of Counseling, suggests that features of the human condition such as
recursion and autopoiesis, combined with the nature of the universe, serve to
invite humans into a more complementary coupling with the larger mind of the
master engineer. He also points out how this idea of fitting with the environment
rather than fighting against it is consistent with Jesus&#8217; message of the kingdom of

       Obviously, such possibilities require the recognition of valid epistemologies
beyond those of science and history, such as are found in human experiences of joy,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
faith, hope, and love. Some researchers are suggesting that it is time to more
fully explore the wide breadth of knowledge found in the human condition if a
clearer picture of mankind&#8217;s purpose and place in the universe is to be achieved.
Alexander Astin, Founding Director of the Higher Education Research Institute
at UCLA, argues that spirituality deserves a central place in higher education
(<a 
href="#Xastin2004">Astin</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xastin2004">2004</a>). He claims that &#8220;more than anything else&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;[this] will serve to
strengthen our sense of connectedness with each other.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;This enrichment of our
sense of community will not only go a long way toward overcoming the sense of
fragmentation and alienation that so many of us now feel, but will also help our
students to lead more meaningful lives as engaged citizens, loving partners and
parents, and caring neighbors.&#8221; At the beginning point of this reverse engineering
project, perhaps it is too early to speculate about indications of the ultimate
purpose for mankind, but it seems that Dr. Astin has put his finger on the pulse of
what may be humanity&#8217;s greatest desire, function and purpose&#8212;that of love.
A scientific perspective of love is currently being pursued by the Institute for
Research on Unlimited Love at Case-Western Reserve University. Thomas Jay
Oord, theologian for the institute, has written extensively on this topic, including
<span 
class="cmti-12">Science of Love: The Wisdom of Well-Being </span>(<a 
href="#Xoord2004">Oord</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xoord2004">2004</a>). He says that &#8220;to
love is to act intentionally, in sympathetic response to others (including God),
to promote overall well-being&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xoord2004">Oord</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xoord2004">2004</a>, p.&#x00A0;75). Given the high value that
humanity has placed on love throughout history, and its power to change lives for
the better, it is hard to imagine that, if humans do have purpose, it would not
have something to do with love. One example of a scientifically rigorous and
testable model of the cosmos, which postulates the love of a master engineer
and encourages humans to return that love as part of their primary purpose, is
documented in the book <span 
class="cmti-12">More than a Theory </span>by astronomer Hugh Ross (<a

<!--l. 1156--><p class="noindent" >The advance of science in several areas is helping to identify the many affordances that the
cosmos provides for higher life forms like human beings (Barrow, Morris, Freeland, &amp;
Harper Jr, <a 
href="#Xbarrow2008">2008</a>). These affordances are facilitated by the integration of the many
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
subsystems of our world, which also exhibits affordances between subsystems. The
connectedness of the universe is aptly described in the following quote by the famous
naturalist, John Muir, &#8220;When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched
to everything else&#8221; (<a 
href="#Xmuir1988">Muir</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xmuir1988">1911</a>, p.&#x00A0;110). Some scientists have suggested that
such affordances can lead to a clearer understanding of worldview, and human
meaning and purpose (<a 
href="#Xdenton1998">Denton</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xdenton1998">1998</a>). This is not surprising since that is ultimately
what reverse engineering and design recovery procedures were designed to detect:
what was the original engineer thinking? It is clear that the application of reverse
engineering to natural systems cannot be separated from the worldview of the
investigator because the concept of an engineer is critical to the study. Recall
the importance of the relationships between engineer, artifact, and user in this
regard. The authors have suggested that there is another entity that should be
included in this grouping: the investigator or reverse engineer. In fact, the worldview
of the reverse engineer, while playing a role in the study, may also be further
shaped in the midst of the study. A classic example is the case of Charles Darwin,
who, early in his career, greatly admired the works of natural theology, such as
penned by William Paley, while later on, he expressed doubts as described in his
writings.<sup><a 
href="#ennote-23" id="enmark-23"><span 
class="cmr-8">23</span></a></sup>



</p><!--l. 1206--><p class="indent" >       In teaching the process of reverse engineering and applying it to natural systems, it
must be recognized that worldview plays an important role, and that worldview
implications may result. The particular worldview of an investigator may or may not
facilitate discovery and reverse engineering in natural systems. The extent to which a
worldview is helpful in this regard is simply the extent to which a worldview is an accurate
understanding of reality. Care should be taken to allow students and investigators to shape
their worldviews in accordance with the evidence. Worldviews are determined based on
various kinds of evidence and experiences, but scientific evidence typically plays a major
role. The fact that the natural world is so readily and profitably reverse engineered
suggests that the cosmos actually is an engineered system; it is the work of a
Mind with extraordinary engineering expertise. Investigators should not hesitate
to consider this perspective, since it not only seems to facilitate discovery but
may also provide a sublimely satisfying understanding of personal meaning and
purpose.




</p><!--l. 1228--><p class="indent" >       A research study involving undergraduate honors students and faculty from a
diversity of academic fields, including engineering, theology, psychology, engineering
physics, music, biology, chemistry, and biomedical engineering is currently underway at
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Oral Roberts University (<a 
href="#Xhalsmerbeck2012">Halsmer &amp; Beck</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#Xhalsmerbeck2012">2012</a>). The students engage in weekly
extra-curricular research and discussions centered on the hypothesis of &#8220;God as Engineer.&#8221;
This hypothesis is continuously evaluated in light of a serious engagement with
mainstream scientific understandings as well as a respect for traditional religious
truth claims. Students assess research in the sciences, mathematics, humanities,
theology, and reverse engineering methodologies for applicability to the hypothesis in
question. Weekly meetings are held to discuss findings and develop journal articles,
conference papers, and presentations. The diversity of academic fields represented
provides rich and fertile ground for discussion and conflict resolution. Survey
data from current and previous group participants suggest that these studies
help students to solidify personal integrity, knowledge of purpose, and spiritual
vitality, and enhance their ability to effectively communicate such convictions.

       <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10   </span> Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 1257--><p class="noindent" >As the concept of reverse engineering is increasingly applied to natural systems, it will be
helpful for students and investigators to understand the procedures for such studies. Such
procedures appear to be largely absent from the current literature. A reverse engineering
procedure is outlined which makes use of the concept of affordance, a recent innovation
from the field of design engineering. It is suggested that affordance-based reverse
engineering may be particularly useful when applied to complex natural systems. The
example of human life is briefly discussed. It is recognized that investigator worldview is
inseparable from such reverse engineering studies, for they are not conducted in a vacuum.
Furthermore, worldview may be significantly shaped in the midst of such endeavors, since
reverse engineering and design recovery activities ultimately attempt to identify
original meaning and purpose. Anecdotal and survey data from undergraduate
students engaged in such studies generally indicate an increased appreciation for the
affordances of life and the ingenuity displayed in the cosmos. They also demonstrate an
increased ability to articulate a satisfying and coherent understanding of the meaning
and purpose of human life, as well as the reasons for the hope that they possess.
