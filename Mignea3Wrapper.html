and Part 2 of this study of the design of the Simplest Self-Replicator (SSR), the
complexity of the SSR, and the feasibility of construction of an artificial, autonomous

<a

<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >The analyses from Part&#x00A0;1 and Part&#x00A0;2 demonstrated that even the Simplest Self-Replicator
(SSR) has a strikingly complex design. Beginning with the goal to design an SSR that can
accurately reproduce itself and using logical, empirical, and systematic methods, it was
shown that the artificial SSR must have a rich set of fully integrated advanced capabilities
(functions). Any project or attempt to construct an artificial SSR requires the
employment of the most advanced engineering techniques using the latest technologies.

<a

<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Scientists working in molecular biology, genetics, biotechnology, bioinformatics, and related
disciplines have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of the cell and
the information that drives some of its activities. However, it is in the author&#8217;s estimation
that scientists and engineers are still at the beginning of a lengthy road to discover many of
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
the remaining mechanisms, information repositories and processes in living cells and
organisms. Here are some areas that are so far still hidden (at least partially) from human
knowledge:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">What are the mechanisms for information communication in the cell? Some
      have been identified, but many still remain to be discovered.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Where in the cell is the information stored for building the the cell&#8217;s body
      plan,  including  the  type,  number,  and  orientation  of  the  cell&#8217;s  organelles?
      Additionally, will these organelles be linked to each other and other cellular
      structures? Finally, what is the specific, biochemical composition of each type
      of organelle?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">How is the &#8220;supply-chain&#8221; function achieved in a cell, supplying the needed
      organic material building blocks for protein and organelle construction at the
      right time?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">What is the nature of the computations performed within the cell? Is it based on
      protein/enzyme interactions only? Are there any other forms of computations?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">What are the inner mechanisms or control centers that drive cell growth and
      cell division?</li></ul>
<a

<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >       Many of the necessary functions for self-replication elucidated in Part&#x00A0;1 of this
study have not been identified within the cell yet, or have only been understood
superficially.

 id="x1-40001.3"></a>The material basis for an artificial SSR</h4>
<a 
 id="dx1-4001"></a>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >The most recommended approach for the design and construction of an artificial SSR is
based on biochemical materials and a cell-like construction scale. However, the lack of
knowledge of so many cellular functions and the technological limits to operating at the
cellular level of scale makes this approach impractical and condemned to failure. The goal
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
is to construct an artificial SSR from inert chemicals using a biological material basis, with
full understanding and control of all elements and mechanisms involved in such
a construction. An accomplishment like Craig Venter&#8217;s synthetic bacterial cell,
although remarkable, is not at all at the level of achievement this would imply, since
Venter&#8217;s project utilized an existing, living organism as the scaffolding for his
project.
<a 
 id="dx1-4002"></a>
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >       The alternative approach for building an artificial SSR is to take a macro-scale
approach using a common manufacturing/engineering material basis. Compared to what is
evidently possible on a biochemical basis, even the smallest miniaturized devices such as
smart phones or miniature motors are clunky by comparison. In the analyses in Part&#x00A0;1
and Part&#x00A0;2 of what is involved in the design and construction of even a clunky
artificial SSR, design requirements such as the energy closure, material closure, and
information closure make the author skeptical that even the most advanced labs
in the world would be able to design and construct a fully-functional SSR on a
macro-scale.

      enormous  difficulties  in  the  design  and  construction  of  a  macro-scale

           <li

           i.e., between represented abstractions. For example, a part can be made

           procedures.</li></ol>

<a

<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >The functional model of the SSR developed here has shown that the SSR must be
composed from a large number of well-defined capabilities and mechanisms whose behavior
must be integrated, synchronized, and coordinated in their interactions. An SSR cannot
grow and duplicate if all these functions are not in place and fully functional. The SSR
growth and replication processes cannot be achieved with only one or a subset of the
required functions. All must be in place from the beginning. For example, it is not enough
to have a fabrication function (RNA) if it is missing the fabrication plan catalog (DNA).
Or, even if it has both the fabrication function and the fabrication plan catalog (RNA
+ DNA) but is missing the input flow control function (membrane controlled
pores) and the division control function, the &#8220;primitive SSR&#8221; will not be able to
replicate.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >       The level of sophistication, autonomy, self-sufficiency, and complexity of the
simplest single-celled organisms is beyond the level of technological sophistication
achieved by humans thus far. The laws of nature cannot generate highly structured
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
information, because the kind of information needed for the catalogs that are also
needed by the SSR are not repetitive or law-like. Likewise, chance cannot be
responsible for such information because the catalogs must be finely tuned to
deliver accurate information, with small deviations leading to the possibility of
catastrophic consequences. Given the rational structure and plan of the cell&#8217;s
internal arrangement, its information, and its sophisticated mechanisms&#8212;whose
sophistication has only been partially understood by humans because of its enormous
complexity&#8212;could not be the result of natural processes&#8212;the laws of nature or random
events.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >       The belief that the laws of nature and any sequence of natural events and
circumstances could have created a self-replicating cell does note have a rational
foundation. This author contends that it is purely a statement of faith without a defensible
scientific or empirical basis. These considerations lead the author to the conclusion that a
naturalistic explanation of the origin of life is impossible. It is unreasonable to conclude
that while the smartest human scientists and engineers are currently unable to design and
construct an artificial SSR from scratch because of its supreme complexity, some
random sequence of natural events could have produced such a sophisticated
self-replicator.

       property of producing, in the course of its movement, another watch like
       itself (the thing is conceivable); that it contained within it a mechanism,
       a system of parts, a mould for instance, or a complex adjustment of
       lathes, files, and other tools, evidently and separately calculated for
       this purpose; let us inquire, what effect ought such a discovery to have

       These analyses have shown that there are strong reasons to be skeptical that
humans are able, at this time, to design and build a fully autonomous self-replicator.
Furthermore, there are stronger reasons to be skeptical that the self-replicators found on
Earth are the results of natural laws combined with random natural events or
circumstances.
       Scientists and engineers at NASA made detailed plans and projects to create
artificial self-replicators to be realized either as self-replicating moon factories or as
self-replicating inter-stellar probes. The time horizon for the implementation of these
projects is either sometime during the 21<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">st</span></sup> century or in the distant future. These
ambitious projects emphasize the technical hurdles that seem impossible to solve with
current technology.
       On the other hand, there is a vast assortment of self-replicators populating the
planet Earth. The estimated number of organisms on Earth is between 10<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">20</span></sup> and 10<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">30</span></sup>, with
an estimated 9.7 million varieties of organisms on Earth. Among those varieties are
bacteria, microbes, fungi, plants, algae, grass, shrubs, trees, insects, mollusks, fish,
birds, and mammals. Some live in the seas&#8212;in lakes, in rivers, and miles below
the ocean&#8217;s surface. Other organisms live in ice, in the Earth&#8217;s crust, or on the
Earth&#8217;s surface. Some smaller organisms live in other organisms in symbiotic
and parasitic relationships. All of these organisms constitute varying positions in
the Earth&#8217;s ecosystem, many providing energy for other biological SSRs. Ocean
plankton serves as food for smaller fish and other ocean creatures that, in turn,
serve as food for larger fish or ocean mammals. On Earth, grass and plants make
up the food for rodents, animals and birds. It appears that for each type of a
self-replicator there is a particular food niche suited for it. The three closure
requirements&#8211;energy, material, and information&#8212;which are so difficult to achieve for an
artificial SSR are routinely satisfied by the internal design and construction of all of these
organisms.
<a 
 id="dx1-6006"></a>
       Many of these organisms are not simple self-replicators. Many are significantly more
complex than the artificial SSR that was proposed in Part&#x00A0;1 and Part&#x00A0;2. They are
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
comprised of multiple cells and cell types. Additionally, while cell replication does occur,
the organism, which is a structured hierarchy of systems of cells, tissues, and organs,
replicates in a more sophisticated way at the whole organism level. This study did not
consider the SSR&#8217;s mobility; however, most self-replicating organisms are mobile, which
significantly facilitates their ability to feed and replicate. Finally, many self-replicating
organisms are endowed with a wide spectrum of sensory organs that allows them to sense
the environment.
       How can one make sense of the presence of this plethora of autonomous
self-replicators? How can one explain the existence of these self-replicators in tandem with
a rational, hierarchical structuring of their food chain and a harmonious integration into
the Earth&#8217;s environmental conditions? <a 
 id="dx1-6007"></a>
       This study has pointed to the immense amount of design and coordination <span

to produce even the simplest self-replicator. This means that, at least from the origin of
biological life, the Earth has had amazingly intricate machines. As the explanation of the
material closure requirement shows, the environment for life to exist must contain suitable
materials in a suitable state for use. As the discussion of the information closure
requirement reveals, the information to perform self-replication had to exist from the very
beginning. As the exposition of the energy closure requirement discloses, each piece of the
working self-replicator must be built to be tied in to the power distribution system. This
indicates that, rather than being built up over time, life has been infused with design
from the beginning. The fact that these intricate interconnections go beyond
individual organisms and extend to entire ecosystems indicates that the ecosystem
itself, with self-replicators ranging from the smallest single-celled organisms to
such multicellular marvels as birds and mammals, operates within the original
plan.
       <span 
class="cmti-12">Homo sapiens </span>occupies a unique place in this continuum of creatures, being not only
a product of the original design, but also a designer himself, with a mind tuned to building
things like houses, roads, bridges, engines, cars, airplanes, and planetary exploration
vehicles. The mind of <span 
class="cmti-12">Homo sapiens </span>looks in amazement to the Earth, at the Sun and
planets, and at the galaxy and beyond&#8212;it is a mind that dreams of conquering the galaxy.
This mind allows <span 
class="cmti-12">Homo sapiens </span>to not only operate within the grand design, but also to
examine and reflect on it himself, and become a builder and designer within the greater
design. With this mind he explores the plants, insects, birds, and animals in the
environment, and studies their make and behavior. Further, this mind allows
him to look into how these living organisms are constructed, investigating their
inner workings. With this mind <span 
class="cmti-12">Homo sapiens </span>has learned and is learning about
the amazing complexity of living organisms, and this author suggests that he
should remain in awe of the magnificent power that created the design at the
beginning.
