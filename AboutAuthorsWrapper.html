       <h4 class="likesubsectionHead">Dominic Halsmer</h4>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" ><img

 />
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >       Dominic Halsmer&#8217;s love for science and engineering began from the time he was a
child playing at the small airport his father and uncles owned. He and his siblings would
work on projects to defy gravity, once even successfully building a kite large enough to lift
a person off the ground using an old parachute and rope. This natural curiosity eventually
blossomed into the work he does today.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >       Dominic went on to earn his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Aeronautical and
Astronautical Engineering from Purdue University, and his Ph.D. in Mechanical
Engineering from UCLA in 1992. College was a time of spiritual searching, but
ultimately he returned to his faith. &#8220;The love and Christ-like example of my parents
made the difference,&#8221; he said. He also notes that the evidence from science for
the truth of the Christian worldview also helped draw him back to his faith.
Today, he has a heart for reaching out with the gospel to skeptical scientists and
engineers.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >       Dominic joined the Engineering and Physics Department at Oral Roberts University
shortly after graduating from UCLA. His interest in flight continues, including
participation in the NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program at NASA Goddard
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Space Flight Center, and working with undergraduates to test the stability of spinning
aircraft under thrust. His current research focuses on studying how the universe
is engineered to reveal the glory of God and accomplish His purposes. In 2013
he earned his M.A. degree in Biblical Literature from Oral Roberts University.
Dominic is married to his high school sweetheart Kate, and they are the parents of
four children. From 2007 to 2012, he served as Dean of the College of Science
and Engineering at ORU, and he now directs the ORU Center for Faith and
Learning.
